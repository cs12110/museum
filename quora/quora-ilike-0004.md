## 生命里最好的感觉是什么?

From:  [What are some of the best feelings in life?](http://qr.ae/TU1Our)

Date: April 08 2018

When I was a child, I frequently wetted the bed.

> 在我小的时候,我经常尿床.

My parents tried everything they knew to make me stop this. I drank less water. I set alarms to wake up in the middle of the night. I was taken to a doctor.

> 我的父母尝试过 ta 们知道的各种方法来让我不尿床.我喝更少的水.我设置半夜起来的闹钟.我甚至去看过医生.

Nothing worked.

> 但都没有起作用.

But I was not affected by it until a few of my relatives stepped in.

> 我甚至都没有受到任何影响,知道一些我们的亲戚介入.

When they came to know of this, they started giving ideas to my parents. However, none of those ideas were encouraging.

> 当 ta 们知道我尿床这件事之后,ta 们开始给我的父母出主意,但没有一个主意取得成效.

He must be sick. He must have contracted some serious illness. Did you check with X doctor? You better do something about this otherwise you would regret later on in life.

> 他一定是病了.他一定被什么严重的疾病缠身.你们照了 x 光吗?你最好去照一下,不然你以后会后悔的.

Gradually yet steadily, this started affecting my mental well-being. I started questioning myself.

Momma, is everything fine with me? Do I have some disease? Are you and dad hiding something from me? Will I die?

> 老妈,我没病吧?是不是我有病?你和老爸是不是藏着什么东西没告诉我?我会挂掉吗?

My appetite dwindled drastically, as if someone had flicked the switch. I slept fewer hours. I wetted my bed more than ever.

> 我的食量开始急速下降,就像某个人转换了某一个开关一样.我睡几个小时.尿床越来越严重.

Every time I woke up wet, I would look around in horror, to check if someone saw me, run to the washroom with the wet trouser and the mattress, put the wet clothes into the washing machine, and come back to sleep.

> 每次,我尿床醒来,我带着惊恐打量的周围,看是不是某些人看见我了,把裤子和床垫拿到卫生间里面,把那些尿湿的衣物放进洗衣机里面,然后再回去睡.(27 年前,有洗衣机,不是一般人呀)

The trauma was real. It was unforgiving. It was reverberating.

> 那是一种确确实实的创伤.不可原谅的.同时反反复复.

I disgusted myself whenever I wetted the bed. I hid this from my parents. I did not want them to be revolted by my shameful behavior.

> 我对每一次尿床的自己都感到厌恶.这些我都不让我的父母知道.我不想 ta 们被我的羞耻行为感到厌恶.

This affected my very persona.

> 这影响到我的人格.

At times, I felt so repulsed about myself that I wanted to peel my skin off, and chisel out every muscle in my body.

> 时常,我对我自己感到很厌恶,甚至我想扯掉自己的皮肤,把我的每一块肌肉都挖掉.

My family was quick to sense the red flags.

> 我的家庭很快就意识到这个严重性了.

While my father was busy consulting people to get a solution for this, my mom had other ideas.

> 在我老爸忙着去咨询别人这种问题的解决方法的时候,我老妈有了其他的想法.

She bought a new mattress. It had pictures of pigeons on it.

> 她买了新的床垫.上面有着企鹅的图案.

That night when I came to my room, the cot was new. The mattress was new. I loved the pigeons.

> 那晚,我走到我的房间,那床是新的.被单是新的,而且我喜欢企鹅.

Just like those regular nights, with a heavy heart, I asked her “Momma, are you ashamed of me because I wet my bed?”

> 就像其他平常的夜晚一样,带着沉重的心情,我问她"老妈,因为我的尿床,你们感到羞耻吗?"

My voice was trembling a bit.

> 我的声音有些发抖.

“No way, darling. It is absolutely normal. Your relatives are idiots. They do not know what they are talking about. Come to me, let me sing for you,” she said, as she put on her glasses, and pulled out a book from the shelf.

> "不是这样的,儿砸.这很正常的.你的亲戚都是傻屌.他们甚至都不知道他们说的是什么.来这里,我给你高歌一曲,"在她带上她眼镜的时候,这样子说到,然后从架子上面拿下一本书.

That night, she sang “What a Wonderful World” to me.

> 那一晚,她唱了"What a wonderful world"给我听.

But something was different that night.

> 但那一晚,有些事,开始变得不一样了.

I looked deeper into her eyes, listening to her unmethodical voice and incongruent pitch. I observed a raging battle in her calm eyes.

> 我看着她的眼睛,听着她跑调的歌.我在她平静的眼里面,看见了一场战争.

I was too young to interpret much but I was sure I saw rough tides. I sensed a tempest.

> 我那会太年轻,解释不了太多,但我的确看见了一个坎坷的潮汐.我感到暴风雨.

As the song was edging to the end, I was almost asleep. She made me lie comfortable, fixed the mattress firmly, and nudged me gently.

> 在那首歌快结束的时候,我差不多睡着了.她让我睡下,整理那些床单,然后把我的衣服脱掉.

My half-closed eyes responded vaguely. “Yes, Momma,” I asked.

> 我半掩着的眼睛,迷糊的回应着,"老妈",我问.

With an absolute calmness and relaxed cadence, She said “Ben, do you see this pigeon here?” she pointed out at one of the pigeons in the mattress. And she continued “…his name is Titus. You know what, he is here to watch you. If you wet the bed, you will wet him and he will peck(she said bite) your candle.”

> 在她平静和放松的语气下,她说"Ben,你看见那只在这的企鹅吗?"她指着被单上面的一只企鹅说.然后她继续说道'它的名字叫 Titus.你知道吗,它在这里看着你.如果你尿床,你会尿湿它,它就会把你的小 jj 咬掉.'

Caressing my forehead, she said that with a naughty chuckle and a truthful voice. She sounded real.

> 摸了一下我的前额,她说这些带着顽皮的轻笑和确切的语气.听起来,好像是真的.

“Really Momma?” With widened eyes, I looked at the pigeon, touched it with my little fingers, brushed its body, and went to bed, watchfully.

> "真的?"带着惊恐的眼睛.我看着那个企鹅,用手指去摸着它,划过它的身体,然后看着它,我爬进被窝里面.

Mom kissed my forehead and left the room, turning off the lights, smiling at me from the doorway.

> 我妈吻着我的额头,然后走出房间,关掉灯光,在走廊对我笑了一下.

I do not know the science behind what she said.

> 我不知道她说的,有什么科学依据在后面.

I stopped wetting.

> 但我停止尿床了.

I am 27 now.

> 我现在 27 岁了.

Two weeks ago, a friend and I were shopping in Abu Dhabi and I found a mattress in a shop.

> 两个星期前,我和我朋友在 Abu Dhabi 购物,然后在一家商店里面发现了一条床单.

It had some beautiful pigeons on it.

> 那上面有一些漂亮的企鹅.

I stopped, walked into the shop, picked the mattress up, and sat on a sofa nearby. As I got lost in my memories, I realized how fast I had grown up.

> 我留步,然后走进那家商店,拿起那条被单,坐在旁边的沙发上面.我在我的回忆里面,迷路了,意识到我长大得有些突然.

The pigeons looked almost the same. Same mattress. Same purpose. I was no longer afraid of it, though.

> 而这些企鹅看起来和之前一样.同样的床单,同样的用途.但我不再害怕了,我想.

I smiled, looking at the pigeon, running my fingers over its beak. The man asked “would you like to see more varieties of this, Sir?”

> 笑着,我望向那些企鹅,手指在 ta 的嘴甲上游走.那个售货员问"你想看更多的被单吗?"

“No, I am buying this,” I said, still smiling. He looked a bit puzzled, smiled hesitantly, and walked away.

> "不用了,我要买这个,"我回答,带着诡异的微笑.他看起来有些疑惑,尴尬的笑了一下,然后走开了.

I called my mom and told her I had a surprise for her.

> 我打电话给我妈,然后告诉她,我有一个惊喜给她.

“What is that, Ben?” she asked curiously. “Check your whatsapp, Momma,” I said, as I clicked a photo of the mattress and sent it to her.

> "那是什么,Ben?"她好奇的问道."看一下你的 whats,老妈,"我说,在我把那张被单的照片发给她的时候.

She called me immediately.

> 她立刻给我打了电话.

We spoke for about ten minutes. We spoke of my bed-wetting times. We laughed hard.

> 我们说了大概十分钟.我们说起我的尿床时光.笑得支离破碎.

The last minute was, however, largely silent.

> 最后的时刻,不知为何,沉默如同 Java 的 bridge pattern.

She paused a while, set her throat right, and said “I was too busy raising you that I have forgotten that you are no more a baby now. Are you really 27, Ben?”

> 她停止了一下,端正了一下语气,然后说"我忙着带大你们,我甚至都忘记你都不是小孩子了.你现在真的 27 岁了吗,Ben?"

To me, this is the best feeling.

> 对于我,这就是最好的感觉了.

I do not know what to call this feeling.

> 我不知道这种感觉叫什么.

## 编程七宗死罪

From:  [What are the 7 deadly sins of programming](http://qr.ae/TU1UuQ)

Date: April 09 2018

a. Using spaces instead of tabs. You should always, always use tabs, not spaces.

> 使用 space 代替 tab.你应该一直,一直,一直使用 tab,而不是空格.(pythoner?)

b. Not using auto-formatting. Forget all that tabs/spaces rubbish, what’s wrong with you — auto-format your code and then people won’t have to look at your weird ideas about brackets and spaces.

> 没有使用自动格式化.忘记所有关于 tab/space 的废话,你错在哪里?格式化你的代码,然后那些人就不会被你奇怪的括弧和空格给迷糊了.

c. Using IDEs, which have features such as auto-formatting and nicely-coloured buttons. All code should be written in vi or Emacs, thus ensuring the purity of the programming experience.

> 使用 IDEs,特别是那种有自动格式化代码功能的和代码高亮按钮的 IDEs.所有的代码应该在 vi 或者 emacs 上面写,那些才能确保纯粹的代码质感.

d. Not using IDEs. No-one wants to pay for all the time it’s going to take you to type things that you could have done at the click of a button, or scroll up and down using some ridiculous key combination invoked using LISP.

> 不使用 IDEs.没有人会一直愿意花时间去写一个按钮就能完成的事,或者通过一些奇怪的按键动上下来组合使用 LISP.

e. Failing to learn C and C++. It’s really important to learn the two absolute essential languages. You think Java is just as good? Fine, write me a real-time control system for racing cars in Java and I’ll believe you.

> 学不好 C 和 C++.学习两门基本的语言是很重要的.你觉得 java 很好?好的,给我用 java 写一个实时的赛车管理系统,那么我会相信你说的.

f. Learning C or C++ when you could be using something modern like Java instead. Admit it — all your schedules involving C or C++ overrun by five years. And even then the software turns out to have critical flaws that Java would not even have allowed you to create.

> 在你使用其他高级语言入 java 来写东西的,使用 c 或者 c++来代替.承认吧,你没用过 c 或 c++起码超过 5 年了.甚至发现你的程序里面有着严重的 bug,那种 java 根本就不允许你创建的 bug.

g. Overrunning the end of an array.

> 数组越界访问.

## 你感受到最大的文化差异?

From:  [What is the biggest culture shock you have ever faced?](http://qr.ae/TU19IY)

Date: April 10 2018

I worked in Japan for 6 months. There, I met a girl who’s also from Croatia. We became really close friends. Besides her, I also met a Japanese guy who became our best friend there. We were going out together, having fun, talking a lot, and giving each other advice.

> 我在日本工 6 个月.那里,我认识了一个和我来自同一个地方克罗地亚的女孩子.我们成为了很好的朋友.通过她,我还认识了一个日本的男孩,在那里也成为了我的好友.我们一起出去玩,寻找乐趣,无话不谈,然后给各自一些其他的建议.

One day, he came to us and told us he wants to bring us to meet his family (which he haven’t seen for over a year). We were in shock. And honored, at the same time. We agreed.

> 一天,他来到我们这边,和我们说,他想带我们去见他的家庭(那个他一年多都没回去过的家).我们有些震惊.同时感到一种荣幸,在同一时间.所以,我们同意了.

The two of us met him around 5pm. He told us, before we go to meet his family, he has a surprise for us. He took us to a place where you can rent a kimono, they did our hair, we choose a kimono we liked and were ready to go.

> 我们两个在差不多 17:00 的时候遇到他.他告诉我们,在我们去见他的家庭前,他给我们准备了一个惊喜.他带我们去一个可以租借和服的地方,然后整理我们的发型,我们选择我们喜欢的和服,然后准备过去.

I can’t explain how special both of us felt. He knew how much we wanted to wear a kimono, and he made our wish come true - although we never asked for it.

> 我不能解释在我们出发的时候有多特殊.他知道我们有多想穿上和服,然后他让我们的愿望成真了-尽管我们从来没有去请求过.

We were set to go. Excited. Thrilled. On our way, he started telling us the story about his relationship with his parents. It was complex. He was so nervous, shaking, thinking this dinner will be a total disaster. We calmed him down a bit.

> 我们准备出发了.有点小激动.还是有点小激动.在路上,他开始告诉我们关于他和他父母之间关系的故事.有点复杂.他有点不安,抖动着,想这次晚餐一定会成为一场灾难的.我们让他平静了一点.

We came in front of the house. The two of us were practicing our Japanese greetings, because his family didn’t speak English. We knew some basic Japanese, but definitely not enough to hold a conversation. We were also a little bit nervous.

> 我们来到他们家的门前.我们两个练习这我们日式礼仪,因为他们家庭不说英语.我们只知道一些基本的日语,但绝对不能应对一场对话的.我们也有点紧张.

We rang the bell. His mom opened and saw the two of us bowing and greeting her in our kimonos. I can’t find words to explain how happy she was seeing us like that. It was the most genuine smile I’d seen in a long time.

> 我们按下门铃.他的母亲来开门,然后看见我们穿着和服在鞠躬.我不能找到形容她看到我们这种礼仪有多开心的模样.她脸上带着我很久都没见过的诚恳的笑容了.

After meeting all of his family (mom, step dad, 2 sisters and a brother-in-law), we sat and started eating and chatting a little bit.

> 在认识他所有的家庭成员(mom,继父,2 个姐妹,和一个堂兄),我们坐在一起吃饭和交谈.

Dinner was delicious, so I (insecurely) said “Oishii”, meaning delicious.

> 晚餐很美味,所以我(不确定)说了"Osihii",表示美味.

His mom said “UKUSNO”. What? That’s Croatian for delicious. My friend and I looked at each other and started laughing in confusion.

> 他妈妈说"UKUSNO".窝草?这是克罗地亚里面美味的意思.我和我的朋友看着彼此,然后迷惑的笑了.(好尴尬)

That’s when his mum picked up a notebook she held behind her. Opened it and showed us Croatian words that she and her husband were practicing for us.

> 当他母亲拿起放在她身后的一个本子.打开然后给我们展示她和她丈夫为我们练习的克罗地亚单词.

The notebook was full: dobro veče (_good evening)_, kako si (*how are you), *kako se zoveš (_what’s your name), etc._

> 那本子上面全是: 下午好呀,你过得怎样,你的名字叫啥呢

I was speechless. The two of them came that day from work, probably tired and they found time (besides preparing us an amazing dinner) to learn some Croatian.

> 我词穷了.他们两个下班回来,可能很累了,还要找时间(在为我们准备丰富的晚餐之外)还去学了一些克罗地亚语言.

I don’t think many people would do it. I didn’t even think about learning something new in Japanese to prepare myself for this dinner… but they did.

> 我想大部分的人都做不到这个.我都没在日本学一些新的东西来为这个晚餐准备...但他们做了.

A little bit later, his sister (she left the room for some time) came back and gave us the drawings she made of both of us. These drawings were beautiful. And we were again surprised. We couldn’t thank them enough. I couldn’t remember the last time I felt so good, or laughed as much as I did with them. The energy that night, the kindness of these people, the relief in our friend’s eyes when he realized that this dinner is everything he needed, it just can’t be described.

> 一会后,他的妹妹(她离开这个房间一会了)回来,然后给我们她画出来的画像.那些画都很漂亮.我们再次被惊喜到了.我们不知道怎么感谢他们.我甚至不记得上一次感觉这么好事什么时候了,或者和他们一起笑了那么多.那一晚的能量,那些人的善良,解开了我朋友眼里的隔阂.他意识到那个晚餐几乎有他所有想要的,这些我都没办法描述出来.

I don’t think I will ever see people who are as nice and polite as Japanese. It definitely made me a better person.

> 我想我再也不会遇见想日本人那样子好而又礼貌的人了.这让我成为了更好的人.

## 你什么时候意识到你成年了?

From:  [When did you realize you were an adult?](http://qr.ae/TU1eof)

Date: April 12 2018

I was 15 yrs old. I had the worst argument with my father. It became violent. I ran away from my dad in my pjs outside in the snow, to escape him. I ran around the house and then across two lawns, banged on my Aunt & Uncle’s front door (who lived 1/2 acre away) and begged them to let me in. At first, my Uncle (my dad’s youngest brother), refused. I continued running around as my dad was still chasing me in their yard! My Aunt finally reasoned with my Uncle and opened a side door to let me in, slamming it and locking the door against my dad. There I was, shaking, legs and bare feet almost purple from the cold snow that I had run in and my pjs were soaking wet, dripping on her kitchen floor. My face was a bright red, blotchy mess of tears, anger and frustration. My Aunt gasped as she noticed some burnt hair and redness on the side of my face. I realized later, he had singed my hair when he had grabbed me and pulled my face toward the stove. My Aunt took me to the bathroom to put me into a hot bath and then to find some borrowed clothes to wear from my cousin, Karen. I realized then I had bruises on my arms, legs and hands. I heard my dad and my uncle arguing loudly outside. I shuddered, thinking that I was not ever going to live with him and his drunken abuse anymore and I was now “on my own”. I grew up in that moment.

> 那年,我 15.我和我爸进行了一次恶劣的争吵.然后就发展成了暴力.为了逃离他,我穿着 pjs(I don't what it is)走在雪地里面.我绕着屋子走了一下,然后穿过 2 块草地,敲响我婶再和叔叔的前门(离我们住的地方不远),求 ta 们让我进去躲避一下.最初,我叔叔(我爸的最小的那个弟弟),是拒绝的.在他们的院子里面,我还给我爸追着.婶仔让叔叔讲道理一点,然后打开旁门让我进去躲避,甩上门,锁紧来不让我爸进来.我在那里,颤抖着,腿和脚都差不多因为天气冷而变得暗紫色,然后我把浸湿的 pjs 脱在他们的厨房地板上面.我的脸颊很红,到处都是伤疤和眼泪,愤怒和挫折.我的婶仔在看见我烧焦的头发和脸颊旁边的红斑后一声叹息.后面我才记得,他抓住我,把我往火炉里面扔的时候,烧掉了我的头发.我婶仔把我带到浴室,给我放了一缸热水,然后把我表哥 Karen 的衣服借给我穿.我看到我的手臂,脚和手上面都是伤疤.我听到我爸和叔叔在外边大声争吵.我颤抖着,想着我再也不能和那个酗酒的人住在一起了,而我只有我自己了.那一块,我就知道我成年了.(村上春树:人都是在一瞬间老的)

## 最尴尬的是什么事?

From:  [What’s the most embarrassing thing you have done in a relationship?](http://qr.ae/TU1cIk)

Date: April 13 2018

The reason for going anonymous is that I don't know how would my husband react to this thing going public.

> 我匿名是因为我不知道这件事公开之后,我老公会有怎样的反应.

But then, this thing gives relationship goals. So here I go.

> 不过,这件事也给我们关系一个目标.所以,下面我来说说.

I had a fairly good pregnancy. But during the delivery, because my baby's head was quite large I had to get an episiotomy done. For those who have no idea about this, it's a cut made between vagina and anus to make the vaginal opening bigger so that the baby's head can pass.

> 我怀孕的情况很好. 但在生孩子的时候,因为我的小屁孩的头太大,我不得不进行外阴切开手术.对于那些不知道这个是什么说明一下,这个手术在阴道和肛门间切开,让阴道变得更大一点,好让那个小屁孩的头部通过.

So well if you are grossed out, don't read further.

> 如果现在都让你吐了,那么请非战斗人员撤离.

Anyway, because of that I had a lot of stiches and the pain was intense especially after a 20 hour labour.

> 继续,因为这个手术我缝补了很多针,这个疼在生产的 20 小时后特别明显.

The doctor advised I should take rest and shouldn't exert myself. And the first pee and the stool would be painful.

> 那医生建议我要休息,自己不要乱动.在第一泡尿的时候,应该会很痛苦.

When I had the urge to pass stool, I went and sat in the bathroom. The pain was unbearable, a little less than labour though. I cried and screamed.

> 当我需要忍不住要上厕所的时候,我坐在卫生间里面.那种疼简直不能忍,就比生小屁孩的时候减轻不了多少.我哭了,并且喊叫着.

The door was unlocked( I had passed out when I had went to pee after the delivery. So husband ordered me to not lock the door) and my husband knocked on it.

> 那门没有被锁住(我在我生完小屁孩之后上厕所晕倒了.所以我老公要我不能锁住门)然后我老公敲了一下门.

“Is it too painful?” He asked through the door.

> "是不是太疼了"他隔着门问.

Clutching my stomach I managed to say a yes.

> 我捂住肚子,准备说是的.

A few seconds later, the door opened and husband gave his hands for me to hold.

> 一会后,那堵门打开了,然后我老公把他的手给我拉着.

I looked up to find him sitting on a chair with his hands stretched out to me.

> 我抬头看见他坐在一张椅子上面,把他的手极力的伸向我.

“We are in this together. At every stage.” He said.

> "无论在哪里,我们在一起"他说.

‘It's gross.” I said.

> "这就有点恶心了."我说.

“It's not. I can't even imagine if I would be able to endure the amount of pain you have gone through. The least I can do is support you. Give me your hand. You can do it.” He wiped the perspiration off my face and gave me strength.

> "我拒绝承认.我都不能想象,如果是我的话,是否能承受你经历过的这些痛苦.我最后能做的就是支持你了.给你的手我.你可以做到的."他把我脸上的汗水抹掉,然后拉我起来.

Tears streaming down my cheeks I held his hand and passed the strenuous test.

> 泪流满脸,我拉住他的手,然后通过了这次艰难的测试.

It was embarrassing then, but now when I think of it, it was full of love.

> 在那时觉得这很尴尬,但现在我看起来,那全都是爱呀.

If you go past something like this in a relationship, you have a one amazing companion for life. And nothing else matters.

> 如果你和你的另一半经历一些和我差不多的事,那么你有一个完好的人生伴侣.而其他的,则是没关紧要的单身狗而已.(在知乎上看见一个同样的,不知道是不是同一个作者.)

I’m not White; in fact, I’m a Black male. But there is one thing I really wish people would stop doing to Whites: I am sick and tired of my White friends feeling as if they have to walk on eggshells around me. I am a grown man who needs no coddling or protection, and I tell people this all the time.

> 我不是白人.事实上,我是一个黑肤色的女性.但有一件事,我真的希望,那些肤色不同的朋友,在我身旁的时候,不用像如履薄冰一样的和我们相处.我是一个成年的人,不需要溺爱和保护,而这些我一直在告诉我的朋友.

But what makes them feel this way in the first place?

> 但是从什么地方开始,他们开始对我们有不同的想法?

Honestly, I think it’s because Whites (especially straight, White males) seem to be the only group safe for everyone to attack. And that’s just dead wrong. We’re so caught up with being “inclusive”, which is a good thing, but it seems we’ve made a mistake: we felt as if we had to identify some “bad guy” or “enemy” who was responsible for all the evils in this world. And, since Caucasians are the majority in this country, I guess we had to pin it on them.

> 说实话,我想这是因为那些白人(特别是那些强壮的男性)看起来是众人攻击的团体里面最安全的那个.然而这个是 tmd 的全是错的.我们计较与`包含` ,这是一件好事,但是我们也犯了一个错误:我们觉得我们必须去鉴定一些`坏人` 或者`敌人` ,他们要为这个世界所有错事承担后果.然后,从白种人在这个国界占大部分的时候,我觉得我们要用图针把他们钉出来一样.

Look, not all Whites are the same (just as not all Blacks are the same). But, when you start blaming all this crap on a particular group *en masse, *don’t be surprised when members of that group start feeling as if their backs were against the wall and start fighting back. Is this the F-ing “racial harmony” we were wanting?

> 你知道的,不是所有的白人都是同一个品性的(就像不是所有的黑人也是同一个品性的一样).但当你开始因为一个特殊的个体而去责备所有人的时候,当其他人开始感觉你触碰到他们底线而开始反击,你就不要感到惊讶了.这就是我们想要的那个操蛋的`种族和谐` 吗?

It’s wrong when you stereotype or discriminate against me, and it’s just as wrong when you do it to the White gentleman beside me. I know I **HATE **being judged by some stupid-assed, blanket racial stereotype, so I know exactly how it must feel when some of my White friends get the same treatment.

> 当你用陈腔滥调和歧视来对待我的时候这是错的,就像你对我旁边那个白人绅士做也一样是错的.我知道我根据一些蠢事,种族论调去评判,所以我很清楚当我的一些不同肤色的朋友受到同样不公平对待时的感觉.

How about we just start judging each other as *individuals? *Good God, is it really that difficult?

> 为什么我们不是根据每个人来判断各自,而不是肤色?窝草,这些真的那么难吗?

## 内向的人怎么享受生活?

From: [How do introverts enjoy life?](http://qr.ae/TU1l7x)

Date: April 18 2018

This is how I celebrated my 26th birthday,

Took off from office.

Booked afternoon show(single ticket) for Fukrey movie.

Post movie I had a KFC lunch meal.

In the evening, few friends(very very close) surprised me with a cake. I am still wondering how did they come to know about it. (I have hidden my birthday in all social profiles. I even remove my DoB from my resume before sharing it to my friends)

Next day, in office I told I was out of city.

> 我 26 岁的生日是怎么庆祝的?

> 请假一天.

> 订一张在午后的电影票.

> 啃着肯德基看电影.

> 在傍晚的时候,几个亲近的朋友会用蛋糕给我庆祝.我一直好奇 ta 们是怎么知道我的生日的.(我把生日在所有的社交软件上隐藏掉了.我甚至从我的简历移除 DOB(date of birthday)了).

> 第二天,在办公室里面,我告诉他们我只是出去了一趟.

This is how in celebrated 2014 new year,

I got one quarter of whisky and 1 plate of chicken lollypop while returning home to office.

I played songs on my laptop.

Then I started enjoying my company.

> 这是我庆祝 2014 新年的时候.

> 在下班回家的时候,我买了一杯威士忌,还有一碟鸡米花.

> 打开电脑里面的歌曲.

> 然后我开始享受只有我自己的陪伴了.

This is how I celebrated my first salary(July 2011)

Was eagerly waiting whole day for salary to be credited.

Kept on logging to bank account every hour to check updated balance.

Returned back from office. Was bit sad as i did not have a broadband connection back home.

Was surprised(since it was first experience with bank) and happy at same time to get sms for salary credited.

Went to nearby ice cream parlour and treated myself.

Since last 2.5 years I am enjoying my own company in a 1bhk flat. I prepare meal for myself and keep treating myself with gifts on occasions.

> 这是我庆祝我第一份薪资的时候(2011 年 7 月)
>
> 一整天都在等待工资到账的那一刻.
>
> 几乎每一个小时都会登录进去查看余额.
>
> 下班回去之后.有点小伤心的是,我在房子里面没有宽带.
>
> 有点小惊喜的是(这是我第一次去实体银行),然后很高兴的从工资卡里面拿出钱来.
>
> 走到最近的冰激凌商店里面,款待我自己.
>
> 在后面的 2 年半时间里面,我享受自己待在公寓里面.我给我自己准备了肉和偶尔买一些礼物给自己.

Well I am an introvert.

We don’t need a company to enjoy

We can cut down on external noise and and know what keeps us happy

Our plans generally work out as we don’t depend on others

We keep ourself busy in some active which gives us pleasure, eg Reading, cooking, painting, etc

We may be surrounded by people but we may feel lonely

I would like to cite few examples from my life.

> 好吧,我 tmd 是一个内向的人.
>
> 我不需要别人的陪伴才快乐.
>
> 我的计划不需要别人的帮忙也可以按时进行.
>
> 我忙于让自己快乐的事,如阅读,煮饭,画画那些.
>
> 或许我们都被人环绕,但我们感到孤单.
>
> 我想我会去某一些城市的,在一生里面.
>
> (BTW,内向的人,是没有生活的 !!!)

You know you’re beautiful. There’s no doubt about that.

But sometimes, you act like you’re only beautiful on a physical level.

And you’re very, very wrong.

> 你知道你很漂亮.这是不需怀疑的.
>
> 但有些时候,你表现得你只是金玉其外败絮其中.
>
> 然而你错了,错得很离谱.

You’re beautiful because you’re adventurous. Brave.

You’re never afraid to try new things with new people.

> 你漂亮是因为你是那些敢于冒险的人.牛逼的人.

> 你从不害怕和陌生人尝试新的事.

You’re beautiful because you’re not afraid to ask for help when you need it.

Even if it makes you look a little silly.

> 即使这让你看起来有些蠢萌.

You’re beautiful because you laugh at everybody’s jokes, even when they’re not funny.

> 你漂亮是因为你捧每个人的场,即使那人的并不怎么样.

You’re beautiful because you’re genuine.

You don’t act like someone you’re not just to get other people to like you.

> 你漂亮是因为你是天才(当然啦,我可是樱木花道).
>
> 你不会显得别人不和你一样而格格不入.

You’re beautiful because you’re not self-conscious.

You dance like nobody’s watching. You talk like you don’t care what people think.

There are few things I can think of that are more beautiful than that.

“Who was the first person on the moon?”

> "谁是第一个登月的人? 是谁,是谁,是谁?"

Most people will know this, and answer instantaneously.

> 大多数的人知道这个,然后立刻回答

“Neil Armstrong”

> "尼尔 阿姆斯特朗"

What if instead I asked who the second person to step on the moon was. 9 out of 10 times, I will probably get a blank stare.

> 如果我替代来问谁是第二个登月的人呢.十次有九次,我甚至可能会被翻白眼.

Buzz Aldrin. The second person on the moon was Buzz Aldrin.

> Buzz Aldrin.第二个人是 Buzz Aldrin

Both men on the same mission, stepped foot on the moon almost at the same time, but only the first one is remembered. I think the face of this mission should be the entire Apollo 11 team, and not only Neil Armstrong. History only remembered Armstrong, and that is pretty unfair to all the other team members, who served very important roles in this historic mission.

> 两个人在同一个任务里面,踏上月球也几乎是在同一时刻,但第一个就被铭记了.我想这个任务要被铭记的是整一个 Applo 11 的团队,而不仅仅是 Neil Armstrong.历史仅仅铭记 Armstrong,这对鞋整一个团队的其他人是不公平的,对那些为这次历史贡献的人也是不公平的.(那么发明那首飞船的人是谁?窝草,这不就是扛精吗)

And Buzz Aldrin is known as the man who first urinated on the moon…

> 然而 Buzz Aldrin 是第一个在月球上随处大小便的人...

Have you ever seen a movie called “When Harry met Sally”?

Harry declares he never picks up a new girlfriend from the airport. Because, as the relationship progresses she will say “remember when you used to pick me up at the airport?” Or “why don’t you ever pick me up at the airport anymore?”

> Harry 说他从来不去机场接他的女朋友.因为,之后的情里面,她一定会说"你还记得你之前经常在机场接我吗?" 或者 "为什么你不再去机场接我了?"

His point is that in the beginning of a relationship, in an attempt to impress, you set the wrong expectations. You become someone other than who you are. You do things that are not sustainable.

> 他的观点是,在这段恋情开始的地方,你努力去惊艳对方,这是一个错误的做法.你成为了比你平常更好的的人.你做那些你平常根本不能忍受的事情.

For a successful relationship, forget about being impressive. Stick to who you are. That’s who you want her to fall for.

> 对于一段成功的恋情,忘记怎么去惊艳吧.就做你自己就好了.你自己才是你想她沉沦的人呀.

My boyfriend used to drink before we were in a relationship. Once we started dating I asked him to stop boozing. He without any hesitation said okay. And it's being 8 years now,he didn't even touched alcohol once.

> 我男票在和我交往前,喜欢喝酒.在我们开始交往的时候,我要求他不要再喝酒了.他一点也没迟疑的答应了.到现在已经 8 年了,他一次也没碰酒了.

So, a couple of months ago, we were just sitting together and chatting about all the random things. And I asked him:

> 所以,在几个月前,我们坐在一起,然后随便聊着一些什么.然后我问他:

Me: why did you stop boozing?

Him: for you.

Him: I don't have any.

> 他抚摸着我的后背说:

My father died because of his uncontrollable drinking habit. My mother had to take care of everything. I know how hard it is for a single mother to sustain in this society. I know that you are so innocent, that you can't even go to any other place without me.I don't want you to face the struggles that my mother has faced. That's why I decided to stay away from alcohol, when you came into my life.

> 我爸因为酗酒早就挂掉了.我妈要悉心照料生活里面的一切东西.我知道在现在的社会里面一个单身母亲过得有多难.我知道你天真可爱,你甚至都不能自己单独去一个地方.我不想你面对我妈曾经面对过的困难.这就是你走进我的生命的时候,我远离酒精的原因了.

Tears rushed into my eyes ,my face turned all pink because I was crying so much.

I said: I LOVE YOU

> 我说: 山无陵.

He wiping my tears said:I love you too mad girl.

Iam the mad one in our relationship. He is the mature one. He usually talks less. He don't usually express his feelings.

> 我是在关系里面比较疯狂的那个.他是比较成熟的那个.他习惯于沉默.他不常表达自己的想法.

But that day, when he said so,I realized that mature love is not buying chocolates and gifts , but leaving something that you love so that you can stay longer with your loved ones. Mature love is loving someone selflessly and unconditionally.

> 但那天,当他说出这个的时候,我意识到成熟的爱情不是买一盒巧克力什么的,而是放弃你喜欢的东西为了更好的和你爱的人活在一起.成熟的爱就是无条件和奋不顾身的爱上另一个人.

EDIT : Thanks for all the love and up votes:)

To those people who said that he is lying: May be he was lying, but I choose to trust him. Because love is trust.

> 对于那些说他骗我的人: 或许他在撒谎,但我选择相信他.因为爱就是相信彼此.

And to the people who are saying that I’m gonna leave him one day: We got engaged a couple of days ago and our wedding is in June(yayyy!! :P).

How old will I be when my brother is 15?

You’ll be 18.

## 老师教过你们最好的是什么?

From: [What is the best thing a teacher taught you?](http://qr.ae/TUTrV9)

Date: May 08 2018

In Health 9B (read, Sex Ed) our teacher, Ms. Smith was teaching us about safe sex.

> 在我们卫生健康课上,我们的大姐头 Ms. Smith 正在教安全性教育.

“Jesus, kids, I’ve said it fifty times and I’ll say it again-never have sex without a condom,” she said.

> "我去,小屁孩们,我说了 50 次了,我还会一次又一次的说,不要发生没保护措施的性行为,"她说.

“If you love her, wear a cover. No glove, no love. Etcetera.”

> "如果你喜欢她,带套吧.没套,就不要折腾了.等等"

In the back, some kid smirked, tipped his chair back.

> 在后面,一些狗男人开始会心一笑,靠在椅背上.

“What if it’s too big?” he asked.Ms. Smith narrowed her eyes.

> "如果太大了呢?"他像市银丸一样闭着眼睛问 Ms Smith.

“What?”

> "蛤?"

“What if my dick’s too big?” he asked, among some tittering.

> "如果我的 JJ 太大了呢?"他问,中间夹杂着一些傻笑.

“For a condom?”Ms. Smith snorted.

> "对于避孕套?"Ms Smith 轻蔑一笑.

“There’s one who asks in every class. You really wanna know, Patrick?”

> "这个问题是你们在这节课都会问.你真的想知道吗,little shit?"

“Uh-”Ms. Smith reached into her desk drawer, and pulled out a condom.

> "哼-"Ms Smith 从她的抽屉里面拿出一个避孕套.

“This is a medium,” she said. She pulled it open, and bent over.

> "这是中等型号的"她说.然后她打开它,然后展开.

“Watch,” she said.

> "看呀."她说.

And we watched, amazed, as she stretched open the condom and proceeded to pull it over her enormous foot, orthopedic shoe and all.

> 然后我们一脸惊奇的看着,看着她把那个避孕套套入她巨大的腿里面,甚至包含了她的鞋子.

When she was done, the condom was stretched snugly, but in no danger of snapping, across her foot.

> 当她完成的时候,那个避孕套还能舒适的伸展,并没有破的危险,在她的腿上.

She gave it a little wiggle.

> 她轻轻的摆动着她的腿.

“So, kids,” she told us. “If a guy says his dick’s too big for a condom-he’s lying. Get out of there. And if his dick’s bigger than my foot-well, there’s something wrong with him. You probably shouldn’t be going out with him anyway.”

> "所以,小屁孩"她告诉我们."如果一个男的说比避孕套还大.继续扯吧.如果比我的腿还大,那他肯定有病.你应该不能再和他玩了."

God. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think of that class.

> 窝草,此后的每一天,我都会回想起这一节课.

## 生活里面,你最怀念什么?

From: [What do you miss most in your life?](http://qr.ae/TUTKMY)

Date: May 09 2018

I grew up in poverty with 9 brothers and sisters and 2 disabled parents. My father is the reason I’ve done just about anything and everything in my life. He’s the greatest person I’ve ever met.

> 我在一个贫困的家庭里面长大,我有 9 个兄弟姐妹和有残疾的父母.我爸是我生活里面的铠甲.他是我见过最伟大的人.

My mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and paranoid schizophrenia. She became so ill that the voices inside her head would tell her to kill us. She would lock us in closets and set the floor on fire. We became so used to this procedure that we hid butter knives in every closet just in case we had to escape. After burning down our house twice, my father decided to quit his job because he didn’t feel comfortable leaving us alone or abandoning his sick wife. My mother may sound evil, but she was the most beautiful and friendliest woman I’ve ever known before her brain started to deteriorate.

> 我妈被诊断为脑瘤和精神分裂.她病得太厉害了,她脑子里面的声音甚至叫她杀掉我我们.她会把我们锁在柜子里面,然后在地板上点起一堆火.我们对这个都习以为常了,我们在每一个柜子里面都藏着一把刀,应对万一要逃跑的情况.在烧掉我们房子两次后,我爸决定辞职,因为他对我们在家不放心或者抛弃他患病的妻子.我妈听起来像魔鬼,但她在脑瘤之前是我知道最漂亮和最友好的人了.

Although poor, my father would make sure we ate every day even if it meant sacrificing his own portions. I didn’t learn about the luxury of eating 3 meals a day until I joined the military. Sometimes our daily meal would be cereal and water or boiled water and bouillon cubes.

> 尽管很穷,我爸会保证我们每天都有吃的,即使要把他自己吃的让给我们.在我加入军队前,我都不知道一天原来可以吃三餐的.有时,我们日常食物会是粥或者开水和清汤.

Whether I’d ask him for a gift on Christmas or the reason why we’re poor, he never told me a single lie. He would walk with me around the neighborhood and explain the drug addicts, dealers, gangs, prostitutes, homeless, etc. He was always trying to make me aware of my surroundings without swaying from the truth.

> 不论我在圣诞节要一份礼物,还是我们为什么这么穷,我爸都没有对我掩饰过什么.他会带着我散步,然后给我解释药物上瘾,经商,妓女,流浪汉那些东西.他一直让我意识到我的周围是很现实的.

He was also a great role model and a man who lived by his word. He truly believed in leading by example. He never neglected or belittled anyone. Every person in our neighborhood knew of him and felt comfortable approaching him.

> 他同时活在他周围里面的模范男人.他相信榜样的力量.他从来没轻视和忽略任何人.每一个认识他的邻居,在他周围也不会觉得尴尬.

While growing up he would always hold me tight and say, “I got you in a love-lock”. As a child, I would hysterically laugh while playfully fighting and begging for him to let me go. As a 6’5” and 240lb soldier, I’d still hysterically laugh by his bedside and pretend I couldn’t get out of his grips even though his hands grew fragile from cancer.

> 当我们长大的时候,他经常抱着我说,"我会给你一把爱的枷锁".还是一个小屁孩的时候,我会笑得花枝乱颤,然后求他把我放走.在我是一个士兵的时候,我依然笑得花枝乱颤,然后假装我不能摆脱他的拥抱一样,即使他的手臂因为癌症而变得软弱无力.

Today, I wish my father could still put me in a “love-lock”. I don’t miss poverty, but I do miss my father. I’d re-experience everything just to be able to spend time with him again

> 现在,我希望我爸仍然可以给我一个"爱的枷锁".我不怀念贫穷,但我的确怀念我的父亲.我愿重新经历之前所有的事情,来换取一些和他共处的时间.

Date: May 10 2018

In the beginning it’s easy.

> 在开始都是容易的.

So, so, so, so easy.

> 太,太,太 tmd 简单了.

Everything is magic. The way they talk. The way they order food. Nothing they can do could make you any less crazy about them.

> 所有的东西看起来都是魔法.ta 们说话的方式.我们点餐的方式.ta 们做的任何事,都没能减低你对 ta 们的疯狂.

New Love casts a spell on you, makes you irrational, willing to follow someone off a cliff.

> 新的爱情给了你魔咒,让你变得不理性,会跟随着别人爬到悬崖边上去.

But…..

> 但....(生活总是有转折)

Life happens. Eventually things escalate, you end up moving in together. Spending exponentially more time together. And the grind and stress of life will turn the spell of new love into the test of true love.

> 生活还在继续.最后事情逐渐增长,你们在一起生活了.有了更多在一起的时间.然后生活的琐碎和压力会把你的爱情测试看是不是你的真爱.

The way the other person brushes their teeth drives you nuts. The way they open the potato chip bag makes you want to stomp the bag into the ground. You’ll go from missing them terribly to desperately needing a breather.

> 这会,ta 刷牙的方式让你抓狂.ta 们打开薯条的方式让你想把那个盒子夺过来扔掉.你从无时无刻想 ta 到想分开喘一口气.

Bad things will happen for one or both of you, a lost job, the death of a family member, financial troubles, all things that further strain the relationship.

> 一些坏的事情会出现在你或你们两个身上,丢掉工作,或者家庭成员的离开,经济问题,所有的事情都在拉扯着你们的关系.

Getting into a fight will be much, much easier.

> 争吵会更,更简单一些.

Unfortunately, for many, there will come a day when you look back from outside the relationship and wonder what happened to something that started in such a good place, only to become a dead relationship, a flip book of memories with a sad ending, broken under the weight of a many stupid fights.

> 不幸的是,对于大部分人,会有那么一天当你从感情外部回首的时候,会好奇在这个这么好的地方发生的事,最终还是感情破裂,一个翻页的卡通书有着一个悲伤的结局,在那么多的争吵之后破碎.

I’ll give you the most boring, cliched, powerful relationship advice that I haven’t always heeded:

> 我会给你最无聊的,烂大街的,最有用的情感建议,恰恰也是我之前未曾留意过的:

Pick your battles: Some things are worth fighting over. But most things aren’t.

> 不要怂: 有些事是值得你去争取的.但大部分都不值得.

## 阅读会惊艳女孩子吗?

Date: May 11 2018

I read to my four-year-old daughter all the time. She never really seems impressed by it. So I’m going to say no, it doesn’t, based on my personal experience.

> 我一直给我四岁的小屁孩读书.她从来都没被我惊艳到.所以我说阅读不会惊艳女孩子,不会的,基于我个人经历得出.

She’s really impressed when I pick her up and spin until we’re both dizzy, for what it’s worth. If your goal is to impress a girl, it’s worth a try.

> 她在我把她抱起来,转圈圈转到我们两个都有点头晕的时候才会感到惊奇.如果你想惊艳一个女孩子,这个可以尝试一下.(你调皮了,大猪)

Oh. I forgot. She’s also very impressed with my impression of a T-Rex. It’s super easy to do, too. Just pull your arms close to you and say you’re a T-Rex. Try it the next time you’re trying to impress a girl. It will leave an impression. I promise.

> 对了,差点忘了.她还会比我扮为 T-Rex 感到惊奇.这个很简单.只要你把的手臂抱着你自己,然后说:I'm a T-Rex.你下次想惊艳她的时候可以尝试一下这个.这会给她留下很深的印象的.我 tmd 用你性命担保.

Date: May 14 2018

when i was 15 years old I started developing feelings for a girl in my neighbour , although she was just 10 years old but was beautiful.. she used to enjoy my company and looked happy whenever I was around. But I always thought she is just a child now. I always imagined that I will marry her when she gets older. she used to share her day to day events with me. But all the childish stuffs.. But I always felt she wanted to tell me something and will suddenly stop and ran away playfully.. this went for almost one year and she was 11 years old now. One day she said i want to share something with you but I don't know you will believe me or not, that day she behaved in such a mature way, not like an eleven years old. I kept asking and suddenly there were tears in her eyes. And she told me the shocking….

> 那一年,我 15.我开始对隔壁那个小女孩心里面的老狗砰砰乱撞的感觉,尽管那年她才 10 岁,但她漂亮呀.无论在哪里,她习惯有我在她身边.但我一直想她还只是一个小屁孩而已.我一直想象有一天我会娶她的,在她长大的时候.她经常和我分享她的日常琐事.但全都是那些小屁孩的玩意...但我一直感觉她想告诉我一些东西,然后她会突然间中断,然后跑到别的地方玩了...这样子差不多过了一年,然后她 11 岁了.一天,她说我想和你分享一些东西,但我不知道你会不会相信我,那天她的行为很反常,不像一个 11 岁的小屁孩.我继续追问她,然后她忽然间就哭了.然后她把震惊的东西告诉了我.....

My elder brother who is almost 7 years older than me used to molest her since she was 7-8 years old. He used to give free tuitions to her and her brother, he has a very good reputation in her family. She said she even shared this to her mother previously but she instead scolded her back saying you don't want to study that's why you are making such excuses…

> 比我差不多年长 7 岁的哥哥,从她 7-8 岁开始,就调戏她.他经常给她和她的兄弟免费补习,他在她家里面有着很好的名声.她说之前曾告诉过她老妈,但她老妈却责骂她,怀疑这就是她不想学习而想出的借口.

she said she didn't had enough courage to tell me this earlier thinking i will support my brother.

> 她说她之前没有足够的勇气去告诉我,因为她认为我会站在我哥的那一边.

I wondered how she was bearing all this through her childhood and still laughing and playing…

> 我很好奇她在童年里是怎么忍受这些事情,然后还能笑出来和玩乐.

I decided something… I confronted my elder brother and told him in a very cold voice that if you continue doing this I will beat the hell out of him. This worked AND he stopped… out of shame or fear I don't know..

> 我决定做点什么...我来到我哥的面前,用很冷酷的语气说如果你继续做这种事的话,我会把你出屎来.这起作用了,然后他停止了.可能是因为羞耻或者害怕,我不知道.

to be short….

> 长话短说....

After my 12th, I qualified pre medical exam, became a doctor , married her and now we are living away in another city happily.

> 在 12 年后,我通过了每一项考试,成为了一个医生,和她结婚了,然后我们生活在别的城市里面,还算幸福.

Prior to our date, we chatted via text like many Tinderians do before meeting. I told him that I was studying to become a psychologist.

> 在我们约会前,我们像其他的陌陌人一样,在约会前通过短信交流.我告诉他我要成为一个心理学家.

He asked, “Are you going to analyze me?”

> 他说,"你要来分析我吗?"

First turn-off. I told him bluntly that I hate when people say that.

> 第一次失望.我告诉他我不喜欢别人对我说这个.

A few hours before our first date, he asked if we could push back the time— by over an hour— without explanation or apology.

> 在我们第一次约会之前,他问我们可否把时间往前推一点-大概一个小时前-没有任何的解释和不好意思.

Second turn-off. I considered cancelling the date.

> 第二次失望.我考试考虑取消这次约会.

When I showed up to the date 15-minutes late in an Uber, he passive-aggressively asked, “Don’t you live a block away?”

> 当我搭 Uber 迟到 15 分钟后,他很不满的说,"你住得离这里很远吗?"

In fact, I lived a 5-minute walk from where I met him and Ubering actually took longer than that. But, that’s neither here nor there…

> 事实上,我离这里走路只需 5 分钟(资本主义的恶意,5 分钟都要 Uber),但 Uber 却花了比这长的时间.但,这就是忽悠呀.

Third turn-off. How dare he comment on my means of travel.

> 第三次失望.他怎么可以对我迟到不满.

I was prepared not to like him and to use every noticeable flaw as an excuse to stop talking to him after this night. I would have told myself, “at least I made an effort…”.

> 我准备不去喜欢他了,然后利用每一个注意到的他的缺点,在这次约会之后作为不和他交谈的借口.我告诉我自己,"至少我给他机会了....".

Mid-date, I became aware that I didn’t dislike him. Even more surprising, conversing with him was actually enjoyable in spite of the prior turn-offs.

> 在约会期间,我意识到我自己并不讨厌他.甚至相当惊喜的是,在一连串的失望之后,和他交谈竟然感到自在.

By the end of the date, I found myself interested to know more about him. I looked forward to a second date.

> 在这次约会后,我发现我对他很感兴趣,想去更多的了解他.我开始期望第二次约会了.

By the end of our second date, we became absolutely inseparable.

> 在第二次约会之后,我们就分不开了.

Three years later, I am engaged to one of the best people I have ever known. I am so happy that I decided not to let those initial turn-offs determine whether or not this person was worth meeting.

> 时间来到 3 年后,我和他订婚了.我很高兴没有因为我的那些小失望而去判断他是不是值得去交往.

After the fact, my fiancé confessed that he, too, considered cancelling our first date due to me having been a pain-in-the-ass during our text-conversation(s). LOL. I don’t blame him. Thank God for second chances :)

> 在这之后,我未婚夫承认他也一样.考虑取消我们的第一次约会,在我们通过操蛋的短信交流的那段时间里面.窝草,我不怪他.幸好还有第二次机会

Side note: What turns a person off is less important than why it turns them off. In my case, my “turn-offs” were indicators of my own insecurities.

If they ask: “So what is your type of girl?” Or anything related to that, it is a *damn good sign.*

In High School there was this short, pretty blonde girl that I couldn’t take my eyes off of. I casually mentioned to a female friend, “Man, she is as cute as a button.”

> 在那个遥远的地方,有一所高中,那里有着一个闪着光的萝莉,我的视线甚至都不能离开她一秒.我在无意中,对我的一个女同学说到:"我去,她就像按钮一样子可爱."

My friend said, “So go talk to her.”

I brushed it off, “Nah…she wouldn’t be into me.”

> 我都脸红了,"Nah,她根本对我不感兴趣."

So that weekend at a party, that very girl, out of the blue, corners me in a hallway, standing with her face about 3 inches from mine. I was immediately tense. We had never really talked much before that.

> 在那周的聚会上,那个女孩子,在机会结束后,把我堵在公路的角落里面,在离她脸颊只有 3 厘米的时候,我立刻就紧张了.我们之前都没怎么交流过.

## 什么时候你意识到你孩子长大了?

From: [When did you realize your child was no longer a child?](http://qr.ae/TUTwvM)

Date: May 18 2018

When my son was in the eighth grade, he got suspended and I had to leave work early to go get him. When I got there, I asked the principal what had happened. The principal explained that my son had beaten up three other boys and even broke one boy's wrist. I was obviously horrified and asked my son what the fuck he was thinking. He simply told me that the boys had cornered one of his friends and were trying to make her strip for them. Being the chivalrous boy I raised him to be, he put a stop to it. I asked the principal if it was true and he dodged the question. In response to that, I told the school that if they're going to allow sexual harassment, I didn't want my child to attend and took him home. I told my son that I was going to take him out of public schools. He replied by telling me that he didn't want to leave the school because of he wasn't there then who was going to stop it from happening again.

This is when I realized my little boy had become a man. He would rather get in trouble to protect a friend than stay out of the spotlight and potentially face long term consequences.

During the month of March, last year, I was traveling from Chandigarh to Bombay. There was a halt at Delhi for 3 hours. To subdue my boredom while waiting to board my next flight, I started watching the Bollywood movie “AZHAR”, which had released the previous Friday. The person sitting beside me, with a curious look asked: “Are you watching Azhar?”

> 在上一年三月份的时候,我从 Chandigarh 旅行到 Bombay.在 Delhi 那里,我有三个小时的中转间隔休息.为了消磨这段时间的无聊,我开始看宝莱坞的电影"AZHAR",这个刚才上个星期五被发放出来.一个坐在我旁边的人,带着好奇的眼光,问:"你在看 Azhar?"

Me: “Yes, it released last Friday only.”

> 我:"是的,这个上个星期刚刚发布出来."

He: “How did you get this so early, that too with such good picture clarity?”

> 他:"你为什么可以这么早就可以看大,而且像素还很好?"

Me: “Sir, I am an engineer & I do know about few online links since my university days.”

> 我:"我是一个工程师(牛逼咯,工程师最牛逼咯) 而且从我大学开始就知道一些网站(会心一笑.gif)"

He: “Open your share it”

> 他:"打开你的分享"

Me (thought he would ask me to transfer): “OK”

> 我(他应该是请求我发送给他):"好吧"

But to my surprise…..!!! Hell man…!!!

> 但是我惊讶的是...!!! 我草!!!

He: “I am sending you the HD print.”

> 他:"我正在给你发送高清版本."

Now, this was a total surprise for me.

> 现在,这件事变得有趣了.

Me (received the file & shockingly asked): “How did you get this?”

> 我(接收那个文件,然后震惊了):"你是怎么做到的?"

He: “That’s a secret, which I may tell you later. Let’s watch the movie first.”

> 他:"这是一个秘密,我稍后再告诉你.我们先看电影吧."

I shared my earphone with him. We watched the whole movie sitting in the lounge. Meanwhile, he asked me for coffee & snacks; and without any hesitation, I replied in affirmative. That's kinda the doing of Punjabi DNA; can't say NO to food, that too when offered.

> 我和他分享了我的耳机.他坐在长椅上看完了整一部电影.同时,他问我要咖啡和零食.没有任何迟疑,我都立刻分享给他了.这就是那种 Punjabi DNA(大概是什么好的品德都是属于这个的类似吧).不能对食物说不,当你个外人提供的时候.

Me: “Sir what do you do?”

> 我:"你是做什么工作的呀?"

He: “I am a journalist.”

> 他:"我是旅行家."

Me: “Even journalists like you keep pirated things?”

> 我:"尽管像你一样的旅行家,也会看盗版?"

He almost gave a hysterical laugh and then politely asked me to delete the movie from my phone, to which I obliged.

> 他几乎笑到掉下巴了,然后很礼貌的叫我从我手机删除掉那部电影,然后我照做了.

Then, I got up to board my flight. We shook hands & I said, “Goodbye Mr. Journalist, may I know your name please?”

> 然后,我去登机了.我们握了一下手.然后我说,"再见,旅行家先生,我能知道你的名字吗?"

He: “Just Google the director of Azhar movie.”

> 他:"你 google 一下 Azhar 的导演就知道了."

I got a 415V shock seeing his face on Wikipedia page. I was like, “Ohhhhh, oh man! What the duck! We just saw the movie he directed, and to top that, it was a pirated one initially!”

> 我在 wiki 上看见他照片的时候,我就像被 450v 的电电到了.我就像,"窝草.这是何等的窝草.我们刚刚看到他导演的电影,而我刚开始的时候竟然在看盗版."

My mind was completely blank & I wasn't able to fathom what to do.

> 我内心一片空白,然后我都不知道该怎么做了.

I just smiled & left without looking back.

> 我只能脸上挂着微笑,然后不回头,往前走.

IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A WTF SITUATION AND THE MOTHER OF CO-INCIDENCE!

> 这无疑是一个窝草的状况,还是绝对的窝草.
