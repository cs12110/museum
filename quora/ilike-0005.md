## 今天什么让你难过了?

From:&nbsp; [What made you cry with sadness today?](http://qr.ae/TUTDBc)

Date: May 28 2018

That’s saying something for me, since I didn’t even cry when my father died. Or my sister. Or when my kids were born. I honestly don’t remember the last time an actual tear came out of my eye because of sadness. It’s not that I lack emotion… it’s that crying isn’t how my emotions manifest themselves.

> 对于我来说,自从我父亲去世,或者我妹妹去世,或者我的小屁孩出生,我都没哭过了.我确实不记得我最后一次哭是什么时候了.这不是我无情...但哭泣,从来都不是我表达情绪的方式.

Anyway, I was definitely sadder than I’ve been in a long time today.

> 不论如何,我今天比之前有点伤心.

For a stupid, selfish reason too. I know it’s a stupid, selfish reason. No need to tell me that in the comments. I know I need to get the hell over it and stop with the self-pity.

> 为了一个愚蠢的,自私的理由.我知道这是没脑的,所以不需要在留言里面说出来了.我知道我需要 tmd 去停止自怜.

Today, I learned, via a friend’s Facebook post, that one of my childhood friends and neighbors passed away over night. But that’s not even the reason I’m sad.

> 今天,我通过 facebook 的推送知道,一个我童年住在隔壁的朋友去世了.但这不是让我伤心的理由.

He and I were friends in elementary school, mainly because he lived close by and I was allowed to walk to his house. But, in middle school, he started hanging with the “cool kids” and didn’t have time for me.

> 他和我在小学里面是朋友,大部分原因是因为我们住得近,我能进到他的家里面.但在中学的时候,他开始和那些杀马特混了,而不和我在一起玩了.

A lot of my elementary school friends did that in middle school… suddenly didn’t want to be seen hanging out with me.

> 大部分我小学的同学,在中学也这么干了...突然间都不想和我玩了.

Anyway, a couple of years later, when we were both juniors in high school, I found out that he was dating my crush. I found out from her, actually. She mentioned his name, and I was like, “Joe? Yes. I know him. He lives near me.” That’s when I learned that my crush lived near me too, and she became friends with Joe right around the time he quit hanging out with me. She told me that she and Joe had been fooling around ever since middle school, but they weren’t “exclusive” until recently. They’d done everything a couple could do together.

> 些许年后,当我们都上高中的时候,我发现他正在和我喜欢的女孩子在交往.实际上,我从她那里发现的.她提起他的名字,而我就像,"Joe?是的.我知道他.他就住在我附近".这就是我知道我喜欢的那个女孩子也住在我附近,然后在 Joe 不和我玩的那会,她成为了他的一个朋友.她说他们两个从初中起就开始瞎混了,但他们不排外直到最近.他们做了狗男女一切可以做的东西.

When I moved to college, I lost touch with all but my closest two friends from high school. They’d tell me bits and pieces of what everyone else was up to, but I didn’t really reconnect with my old classmates until I got Facebook four years ago, some 16 years post-graduation.

> 当我开始上大学的时候,我除了两个最亲近的朋友,其他的失去了联系.从他们之间我知道其他的一些人零碎的消息.但我没和那些老同学联系,知道我四年前开通了 facebook,完成了一共 16 年的学业后.

I learned through mutual friends that Joe had gone down a very bad path… drugs, failed relationships, run-ins with the law, etc… He was on Facebook too, and we’d sometimes both comment on a mutual friend’s post, but I never friended him. I didn’t have anything to say to him.

> 我从一些朋友之间得知 Joe 走上了一条不归路...毒品,感情破裂,打官司等...他也在 facebook 上面,我们偶尔会在共有的朋友上面留言,但我从来没有加他.我没有什么东西可以对他说的了.

So, all day today, our mutual Facebook friends have been posting pictures of him from high school. There have been dozens of pictures from parties, prom, football games, etc… I recognize most of the people in the pictures. Some of them were nice to me in high school (including my crush, who’s hanging all over him in many of the pictures), but most of them just ignored me in high school.

> 所以,一整天依赖,我们的 facebook 朋友推送一些从他高中以来的照片.那里有一堆的照片,来自聚会,舞会,足球比赛...我认得大部分在照片里面的人.有些人在高中里面对我还是挺好的(包括我喜欢的那个女孩子,那个一直和他闲逛的女孩子),但他们都忽视我.

And that’s what made me sad… seeing all of the pictures from high school of my friends having fun and going to things, knowing that I was never invited to any of those things. I could tell where the pictures were taken. I could tell what year they were taken.

> 然而这些让我有点小伤心.看见这些来自高中的照片,看着他们寻乐,然后为某些事感兴趣,知道我从来没被邀请到这些里面.我甚至可以说出这些照片在哪里照的,在哪一年照的.

“Oh. That’s the student parking lot. It looks like our senior year. It looks like school just got out. They look like they’re having a blast, hanging out by Joe’s car. I’ll bet, if the camera angle were a little wider, you’d see me walking towards my car. I remember them hanging out by his car a lot. They’d see me walk to my car, and never say anything to me unless I said hello to them first. They never once asked me to hang out with them.”

> "Oh,这就是那些学生停留最多的地方.看起来像是我们的早年时光.看起来就像刚才学校出来.他们看起来朝气蓬勃,和 Joe 的汽车一起出去玩.我想,那些镜头有点奇怪,你可以看见我自己静悄悄的走过那辆车.我记得他们一直在那辆车旁边闲逛,从来没对我说过什么,除非我自己先打招呼.他们从来也没叫我和他们一起出去玩."

I know what I was going through those years… the isolation and feeling forgotten… To know that, while they were doing all of those fun, normal high school things, I was probably at home, alone, wasting away those young, care-free years.

> 我知道这些年我经历了什么....那些孤独和被遗忘....在他们做着那些高中该做的寻乐的时候,我可能自己待在家里面,浪费掉了那些年,那些最好的年华.

The pictures just brought to the forefront of my mind some feelings I’d been trying to forget, and it got to me a little today.

> 那些照片把我尝试忘记的东西,重新唤起来了,这让我今天有点小伤心.

OK. Matt’s pity-party is over. Thanks for listening.

> 好的,Matt's 自我可怜结束了,谢谢查看.

## 30 多岁的工程师是尽头了吗?

From:&nbsp;[Is software development really a dead-end job after age 35-40?](http://qr.ae/TUTlEi)

Date: May 29 2018

I am a 64-year-old software engineer who has worked for Apple, Adobe, eBay, Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, FileMaker, XO Communications, 2Wire, Egnyte, Nexsan, and two other start-ups. I have been laid off five times in my career. I always find another job within 3 to 4 weeks — even during a recession. I have had my job outsourced to India or China four times: especially in the last eight years. Nonetheless, there is always another employment opportunity waiting afterwards.

> 我是一个 64 岁的软件工程师了,曾在 Apple,Adobe,eBay,Microsofy,Cisco,FileMaker,XO comuncations, 2Wire,Egnyte,Nexsan,和其他两家创业公司工作过.我 5 次离职都能在 3 到 4 周内找到下一份工作,即使在经济衰退的时候.我把我的工作外包给印度和中国四次:特别是最后这 8 年时间里面.尽管这样子,其他地方都总有招聘的机会.

I love what I do. I’m still doing it; and, I have no immediate plans to stop doing it. Moreover, I am good at it. That’s not so much because I am a genius but rather because I have been doing software development for a really long time and I learned from my mistakes. In fact, there is no wide-spread computer language I can’t program in. Nor is there any OS platform I am not comfortable working on. And, besides the U.S., I have also worked overseas in Apple’s factories in China and Ireland. Besides English, I’ve learned to speak (poorly) Spanish and Italian, and I can manage about a ten phrases in Mandarin.

> 我喜欢我的工作.而且我现在都还在做着,我没有计划去不做这件事.更多的是,我擅长这个.这不是因为我是天才,而是因为我做软件工程师已经非常久了,而我也在填坑中学到了东西.事实上,我并不会太多的编程语言.如果那里有任何的系统平台要开发,我应该不能很好的适应.同时,因为美国的原因,我需要在海外的苹果公司工作,在中国或者以色列.我会英语,还学习了西班牙和意大利语言,而且我能使用十句官方语言.

I have managed to do all this while successfully being married for 40 years, raised two adult children (one who is a Netflix software engineer), and I now have five grandchildren. According to the last Social Security report I receive annually from the government, my total lifetime income to date is: $3,042,040; and, I’m not done yet.

> 我已经成功维持我的婚姻 40 年了,抚养小屁孩(一个在 Netflix 里面做软件工程师),然后现在我有 5 个孙子.每年我从政府里面得到最后一份社会保险报告,我的收入到今天是:$3042040;而且我还在收入都还没终止.

Having said all this, it is very much true that age discrimination and outsourcing is rampant in the Silicon Valley. Before age 45, I had a better than average chance of getting a job after a single interview. Now, at age 64, it takes me about ten interviews before I get the next job. Even then I sometimes have to work as a contractor without benefits. And, I have even learned to tolerate being interviewed by arrogant and entitled young preppies, most whom think they are somehow better than me even though they haven’t accomplished one tenth of what I have, nor have my superb academic credentials. (I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a M.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University — the latter at the top of my class.)

> 说了这些东西,这是因为这个年龄在硅谷里面确实比较尴尬.在 45 岁前,我每一个面试都能收到 offer,而在 64 岁的时候,我可能面试 10 次才能拿到一个 offer.甚至有时候,我还要签订毫无价值的合约.而且,我还得在面试的时候,忍受那些高傲的小屁孩,他们觉得比我厉害,甚至连我十分之一的成就都没达到,或者有我的学历那么厉害.(我有社会工程学位和计算机学位,这些科目我都很优秀.)

So, the answer to your question is: NO, software development is most certainly not a dead end job! It is a great job. Does it get tougher to get your next job as you get older? Oh hell yes. But, so what! If you love it as I do nothing but death or poor health can stop you. All it takes is a determination.

> 所以,对于你的提问,我的答案是: 不是的,软甲开发绝对不是一件有尽头的工作.这是很好的一份工作,随着你年龄的增长,你的工作变难的没?是的,变难了.但那又怎样.如果你像我一样喜欢这份工作,只有挂掉或者健康问题才能停止你.这些都看你自己的决心而已.

Never give up!

> 不要放弃呀.

## 不得不说的

From: [What is something you want to "get off your chest"?](http://qr.ae/TUTByD)](http://qr.ae/TUT6G0)

Date: May 31 2018

The incident that I am going to describe, has completely broken me from within.

> 我将要叙述的事情,是把我完全毁坏的一件事.

One fine day, I was returning from college in one of the AC BMTC Volvo buses. For those of you who don’t know, the Volvo buses have this large space in the middle where there are pull down seats for the handicapped. However, regular passengers are allowed to use these when there are no handicapped people on the bus.

> 一个挺好的日子,我搭乘 AC BMTC 公交回学校.对于那些你不太了解的人,那些 Volvo 公交中间有一块很大的空地有座位留给残疾人的,普通人也可以坐在那上面,在公交上没有残疾人的时候.

So I was sitting on of these seats, and then this girl walks into the bus, an astounding arrogance in her gait. The bus was crowded and all seats were occupied. She scanned the bus, and her eyes fell upon me, the prey.

> 所以我坐在那些椅子上面,然后那个女的上车了,用夸张傲慢的步态走着.公交很挤,所有座位都坐人了.她看了一眼公交,然后她眼睛定在我这里,tmd 捕猎者.

SHE: Excuse me, can you please get up?

> 她: 打搅一下,请问你可以起来吗?

Me: May I know why ma’am?

> 我: 我可以知道为什么吗?

SHE: Well, I’m a woman

> 她: 我是女孩呀.

ME: I’m sorry ma’am, but how is that a handicap? The rules state that I am to give up the seat only for a handicapped person.

> 我: 不好意思,女孩子怎么就是残疾的了?规则说我可以只为残疾人让座.

SHE: Well any gentleman would give up his seat for a lady

> 她: 任何一个绅士都会为女生让座的.

ME(Too tired to argue): Well, sorry. I’m not a gentleman, I’m a rustic rural. I know no chivalry, am purely selfish and hence shall not give up my seat.

> 我(有点厌烦): 不好意思,我不是绅士.我刚进城,我不知道什么骑士精神,是一个完全自私的人,因此我不会给你让座的.

She had a disgusted look and chuckled to myself. However, after a few minutes she turned around and deposited a tight slap on my cheek. “You bastard, how dare you grope my butt?” she yelled, in a blood curdling scream.

> 她用恶心的眼神望了我一下.不论怎样,几分钟后,她回头,然后一巴掌打在我的脸上,"死流氓,你怎么可以摸我的 butt?" 她喊叫着,撕心裂肺一般.

I stood up seething with anger, the blood rushing to my face. My fists clenched, ready to punch the living daylights out of her. However a few more women from the bus approached me and started yelling at me and they all slapped me as well. Soon it was total chaos, guys, girls, the conductor everyone started abusing me and hurting me. I was vastly outnumbered. Someone even threw a bottle at me, and it cut my lip, the scar of which, will remain for life. Soon, the bus stopped, and I was thrown out.

> 我愤怒的站起来,那些血从留下我的脸庞.我握紧拳头,准备去把她打出屎来.然而公交上的另几个女的,靠近我,全都吵我喊着,同时扇巴掌.一会后,全都吵起来了,女的,男的,售票员全都开始打我.我寡不敌众.有个人甚至把水杯摔向我,打破了我的嘴唇,那条疤痕,这辈子都不能好了.然后那公交停住了,我被扔出了公交.(现实中的狩猎)

I reached home bleeding, humiliated and destroyed.I decided not to go to college for 2 days. Well, it can’t get any worse right? Wrong!

> 我流着血回家,感到羞辱和被毁了.我决定我那两天不去学校.好吧,这不能更坏了,对吧? 你 tmd 又错了.

There were a few girls from my college, who were on that bus and they spread the news like wildfire. When I went to college 2 days later, he called me to his office and issued a letter of suspension for 2 months. I tried my best to reason with him, that I was being falsely accused, but he would hear none of it. I walked out of his room, to the gates of my college through the lawns, where students saw me and started yelling “ molester molester”. My friends cut off all contact with me, my parents disowned me and my girlfriend broke up with me

> 那公交上面有几个来自我们学校的女孩子,然后在学校散布着这条消息.等我两天后去到学校的时候,他(辅导员之类的吧)叫我到他的办公室,提交一份检讨,然后停学两个月.我尝试给他解释,我是被冤枉的,但他一句也没听.我走出他的办公室,穿过草地走到校门外边,那里有一些学生在喊着"电车痴汉".我的朋友和我断绝了联系,我的父母和我断绝关系,我的女朋友也和我分手了.

All of this for what? Because I didn’t give my seat to that over- entitled, fucking feminazi bitch! I swear to GOD, if I see her again, I will murder her.

> 这些全都是为了什么?仅仅是因为我没给一个狗娘养的让座而已.我向 CPU 发誓,如果我再看见她,我会把她干掉的.

This is my story- how I went from being a cheerful, gregarious, intelligent person to a self-destructive, depressed wreck.

> 这就是我的故事了- 这就是我从一个好人变成人的故事了.

I wish to die right now.

> 我希望我现在就挂掉了.

This won’t be a confession, rather than a story.

> 这不是一个忏悔,更像是一个故事.

I am 19 yo medical aspirant who, like 13 lac other students, took up the NEET examination yesterday.

> 我是一个 19 岁的医学生,就是其他的 13 个一样.昨天考完了 NEET 测试.

Now, right from the start, I was always a good student. Kind of like the teacher’s favorite, center of classmates’ jealousy. And hence, everyone seems to be expecting a lot from me. Like, a lot.

> 现在,从一开始起,我一直都是一个五道杠.老师里面最喜欢的孩子,班里最被妒忌的那个.因此,每个人都对我期望很多,是很多的那种很多.

It’s good to know sometimes, that people think of you as that good. But at times, it’s suffocating.

> 有时候,这是好的,那些人认为你是优秀的.但一直以来,这有点令人窒息.

So yes, I studied hard for a year and was all set to take up the examination. I was confident of getting a good college. But of course, as faith would have it, I messed up. Big time.

> 是的,我努力学习是为了通过考试.我有信心可以考到好的大学.当然,理所当然的会考上的,但我混乱了.大部分时间.

Started off easy, wasted lots of time on Biology, had a major panic attack, messed up Physics AND Chemistry. And before I knew it, the exam ended. I went numb. All of those late night study sessions, those tears, practicing questions when others were partying. All in vain. I came back home, told everything to Mom and guess what? Her reaction?

> 从简单的开始,我浪费了太多时间在生物,出现大姨妈,错过了物理和化学.在我意识到之前,考试就结束了.我被惊呆了.那些所有的熬夜复习,那些眼泪,那些练习的问题.全都不见了.我回到家,告诉我妈发生了什么,你猜发生了什么?我妈的反应?

Slap! Slap! Slap!

> 狂扇巴掌.gif

It felt like my cheek just cut open. Her eyes were burning, hideous expressions. She started yelling at me and slapping me all over. I couldn’t hear her. I couldn’t hear anything. It was all coming down on me, but I didn’t know what to do. All of the times when she praised me, loved me for the good ranks, good marks were flashing before my eyes. I didn’t even try to stop her. I couldn’t. Finally when she stopped, she went straight to her room and started crying.

> 这就像把我胸口切开了一样.她眼露怒火,可怕的表情.开始对着我吼,抽打我.我都听不见她了.我甚至听不见任何的东西.那一刻的悲凉,让我不知所措.一直以来为了好成绩她赞扬我,爱我,对我好的场景闪过我的脑海.我甚至没想去躲闪她.我不能.最后当她停止的时候,她直接走到她自己的房间里面哭了.

My entire body had marks. I locked myself up and cried my heart out. I don’t know when sleep evaded. But I just woke up and now am writing this answer.

> 我的身体都有伤痕.我锁起来,哭的一塌糊涂.我都不知道什么时候睡着了.但我现在醒过来,然后写下这条答案.

For every parent reading this, is this why you raise us? Is this why you bring us stuff, love us and care for us? For a set of numbers on a sheet of paper? Are we nothing else to you?

> 为每一个看到这个回答的家长,这就是你抚养我们的原因吗(不是的,人没有义务去爱另一个人的)?这就是给我们东西和爱我们的原因吗?为了那些成绩单上面的数字?还是我们对你来说一钱不值?

We are not that naive to not understand the sacrifices you made for us. But that does not give you the right to kick us when we are down. We understand your position. But shouldn’t you be a little more understanding towards us?

> 我们没蠢到不明白你给我们造成的伤害.但这并不意味在我让你失望的时候,你有权利去打我.我们知道你们的情况.但你们也应该多少了解一下我们吗?

I don’t know why I am even writing this. I have lost it now. My body still aches and I don’t even have anyone to tell that I am hurt.

> 我不知道为什么我写下这些.我失去了东西现在.我的身体还很疼,我甚至没有任何倾诉的人.

## 在学校做过最机智的是什么?

From: [What is the sneakiest thing you did in school?](http://qr.ae/TUTfhZ)

Date: June 04 2018

In high school, I had a teacher that was horrible at grading papers. Ms. Poole loved assigning homework, but hated marking it. She would collect my hard work on time and more often than not, fail to return it back.

> 高中的时候,我有一个老师不喜欢给作业打分.Ms Poole 喜欢布置作业,但不喜欢给它们评分.她经常把我们的作业收起来,但不会给回我们.

When she did, it came back filthy. I once had a paper marked with yellow highlighter and a second smeared with spaghetti sauce. Another time, she gave all the class their papers back, except mine, then said I never handed it in.

> 如果她发回来了,作业变得很脏.有一次我的作业被黄色的污迹覆盖住了,而第二块污迹就是意大利面的酱汁.还有一次,他把全班的作业都发回来了,除了我的,然后就说我的作业没提交.

But I did. That time at least.

> 但我交了,至少在那一次.

It was year 2000 and computers were becoming a thing. So Ms. Poole announced that from then on, all essays were to be typed and submitted on floppy disks. I knew it was because she didn’t want to make proper red pen corrections.

> 在 2000 年的时候,电脑已经出现了.所以 Ms Poole 从那时开始宣布,所有的作文必须是电脑写的,然后使用软盘提交.我知道她只是不想去对文章进行修改而已.

It was senior year; I had senioritis and was also sick of Ms. Poole’s sloppiness. So I decided to hand in a blank floppy disk for my first soft copy assignment. I labeled it with my name, just like she instructed, and turned in a brand new disk.

> 我已经是老油条了.我对 Ms Poole 的敷衍感到恶心.所以我决定提交一张空的软盘来应付我的第一次软件 copy 任务.我写上了我的名字,就像他命令的那样子,然后提交上去.

I planned on telling Ms. Poole that it must have been a glitch or a wrong one when she found the disk empty. Few days later, she gave it back and posted the grades on the board. I thought I failed since I didn’t hear back from her.

> 如果她发现软盘是空的话,我打算告诉她那是软盘的问题.几天之后,她把软盘给回来,然后把成绩公布在黑板上.自从我没听她提起,我以为我会被识破的.

I didn’t fail.

> 我没失败.

I got a B. I suspected that Ms. Poole did not go through the disks. So I kept my mouth shut and handed in another blank floppy for the second assignment. I got a B+. I did the same on the third and fourth.

> 我拿到了 B.我怀疑她连看都没看那些软盘.所以我默默的提交着空白的软盘给第二次左右.我得到了 B+.我在第三次作业和第四次作业也这么做了.

She said my fifth paper was great.

> 她说我的第五次作业写得很好.

Except it wasn’t.

> 除非我根本没写啦. 笑哭脸.jpg

There was no fifth paper on that floppy disk. There was nothing on it actually.

> 那根本都没第五次作业在软盘里面.那根本什么都没有.

I never had to work on another assignment for Ms. Poole’s class again. All she got from me was an empty floppy disk for the remainder of the semester.

> 然后我再也不做 Ms poole 的作业了.大半个学年,她从我这里拿到的只是一张空白的软盘.

I got a A- for my final grade in English that year

> 在最后的考试里面,我拿到了 A-.

My best friend drove me to the ER, where I was put into a backless gown and told to wait for the doctor. So my friend consoled me while we waited two hours for the doctor to show up.

> 我的好朋友把我送到医院里头,我穿着一件露背的黑色睡袍在那里等医生.所以我朋友在等那个医生两个小时的时间内,不断安慰我.

He comes in and takes a long look at my friend. She and her boyfriend were quite passionate, for lack of a better term. Her neck was covered in hickeys.

> ta 来到之后,给我朋友意味深长的一看.她和他的男朋友好激情,在好的方面.她的脖子留着唇印.

Then he looks at me, and asks my friend ‘Are you sure you weren’t the one that was raped?’ And he laughs.

Don’t judge. Let me explain.

> 先不要下结论,请允许我解释一下.

I met this wonderful, kind, loving and extremely good looking guy when I was 19 and he was 20. We met during our undergraduation and there were just sparks. We dated for 3 months before making it official. We had 4 years of wonderful togetherness, bliss and happiness. After our graduation, he got a job at a top software firm in India while I went abroad for my masters.

> 那年我 19,我遇到了一个很帅而又很好的 20 岁的男孩子.我们在大学那段时间认识的,擦出一点小火花.在交往 3 个月后,我们才公布我们的恋情.我们有了四年的美好时光,开心且幸福,他得到一个印度最牛逼软件公司的 offer 在我去国外留学的时候.

The first 2 years was wonderful. I flew down to India when I could and he came over to visit me once too. But an year into working, we weren’t able to make a lot of time for each other.

> 刚开始的 2 年里面都还好.我有时飞回去印度,在我能飞回去的时候,然后他来过我这边一次.但我进入工作一年后,我们不能给彼此抽出时间来了.

But neither of us talked about breaking up nor taking a break. We understood the situations were so and decided to live with. But at the same time, there was a distance that we didn’t know how to handle.

> 但我们都没有提分手什么的.我们知道我们之间的情况,然后谁都没说什么,就这样相处下去.与此之间,我们知道我们之间存在了我们不可逾越的距离了.

The biggest problem was he wasn’t keen on coming to US and I was in a situation where it was necessary for me to be here. Both of us had valid reasons and we didn’t know how to work around them.

> 最大的问题是他不能来英国,而我又因为自己的情况必须在英国.我们都有一堆理由还坚持自己的立场,我们真不知道怎么解决这些问题.

A couple of months later, I was working on a project when I got a call from an Unknown number. It was his friend calling to talk to me. My heart raced wondering something bad had happened to my boyfriend and I excused myself and went to the stairs. I still remember seeing a crumpled paper on the stair I was sitting on and me looking at what was written on it. It had the letters ‘Fact…’ on them. I called him back and asked him if boyfriend was alright. He didn’t say anything for a couple of seconds and later on told me that he was. I was confused. Why was he calling me then. Then he proceeded to tell the story. Boyfriend(lets call him X) met a girl(Y) in a office. She was extrememly nice and very talkative. They quickly became friends. She was also there when he needed help numerous times and vice versa. The friend told me some more details that I would not like to share here as it is personal to her. Infact I remember X mentioning her a couple of times to me as well. At this point my heart was racing and I felt like I knew what was coming. Y fell in love with X and proposed him. Even though X looked like he had feelings he never even spoke to her after the proposal. He shut himself off from anyone who even tried talking about her.

> 几个月后,我在工作的时候接到一个陌生电话.这是他一个朋友打来的.我还在紧张是不是他出现了什么事,我找到借口出去,然后走到楼梯间.我还记得我坐在楼梯间里面,看着的那些破皱的纸张上面写着什么.那上面有"Fact...".我打电话回去,问那个人是不是我男朋友发生什么事了.在刚开始他沉默了一会,然后说男朋友的确发生了一些事.我有点疑惑.那为什么他不打给我.然后那个朋友开始讲述了事件的经过.男朋友(那就叫 X 吧)在公司遇到了一个女孩子(Y).那个女孩子很好而且还是话痨.他们很快就成为了朋友.每一次他需要帮助的时候,她都在他身边.那个朋友告诉了更多一些详细的东西,那些不想在这里分享的东西.事实上,我记得 x 也在我这里提起她几次.在这一刻,我还是颤抖,就像我知道会是这样的一样.y 喜欢 x,然后去追求他.尽管 x 看起来有点感觉,但在她表白后,他不和她再说话了.他把每一个和她谈话的人都拉黑了.

The friend just said ‘SO..’ and stopped it there. I knew what he was asking me. I just said I will talk to him later and cut the call. At that moment I felt betrayed. I know boyfriend didn’t cheat on me. But for a moment I felt jealous. I cried sitting on the stairs and didn’t know what to do. I wanted to end it for his sake so that he could move on but I was also selfish and didn’t want a change in my life. Then I called X and asked him about her. He was shocked that I knew about it and then started sobbing quietly. It broke my heart. I knew our relationship was long over. I knew there was nothing I could offer him now. I also knew he was in love with her. I asked him if he kissed her. He said never. At that moment I knew what I had to do. He would never cheat on me. He would tie himself to me his entire life even if we never meet each other again just because of the fact that he promised me.

> 那个朋友仅仅说"那么....."我知道他在向我请求什么.我只是说我会和 x 迟点聊一下,然后就挂断了电话.在那一刻,我感到了背叛.我知道我男朋友没有欺骗我.但那一刻,我有点妒忌.我坐在楼梯上面不知所措的哭着.为了他好,我喜欢结束我们的恋情,那样子他就可以往前走了,但我又是很自私的一个人,我不喜欢我的人生改变.我知道我们之前早就完了.我已经不能再为他做些什么了.我也知道他喜欢 y.我问他有没有吻过 y.他说没有.那一刻,我知道我要做什么了.他从来没骗过我.他因为对我的诺言会把人生绑起来,尽是我们不再见面.

And I couldn’t let him do that. Even though I knew our relationship had run its course , I did love him. SO I set him free. He tried to talk to me. He tried to convince me. He tried to reason a lot with me. He said that he didn’t love her. But I could sense in his words that he was in love with her. I asked him to not contact me for sometime and move on with his life.

> 我不能让他这样子做.尽管我知道我们的感情最终走上了末路,我的确喜欢他.所以我让他自由了.他尝试去和我聊天.他尝试去说服我.他尝试很多的理由让我不要走.他说他不爱她.但我能感到他的语气里面,他的确喜欢她的.我让他不要在联系我了,然后继续过自己的生活.

Its been 4 years since that day. Today he is married to her. He got married last week. It took me a lot of time to get over him. Probably because I was so used to having him in my life.

> 到现在,已经是四年前的事了.今天他和那个女孩子已经结婚了.他上个星期就结婚了.这让我不知所措.大概,是因为在过去,我都习惯有他在我生命里面了.

But today I m completely over him. I sent him an email wishing him all the luck in his life. That I’m happy for him and that he was a very lucky man for having found such a beautiful soul.

> 但今天我总算跨过去了.我给他发了一封邮件,希望他余生幸福.我对他能找到那么好的另一半感到高兴.

He replied - I ALWAYS was lucky. Thank you for everything.

> 他回复道 - 我一直都很幸运. Thank you for everythin.(最后面这句是作者自己写给自己的吧,我想)

## 难忘的事件?

From: [What's the most incredible coincidence that ever happened to you?](http://qr.ae/TUp1di)

Date: June 07 2018

My best friend died 15 months ago of ovarian cancer in a hospital following surgery to have it removed. We were friends for over three decades. I went to be with her on her deathbed. She didn’t say much, but we had a few very good conversations in the days before she passed that I will never forget.

> 我最好的朋友,在 15 个月前因为子宫癌在医院做摘除手术的时候去世了.我们做朋友已经 30 年了.我也去到她床位那里.她没有说很多的话,在她去世前的日子里面,我们有一些我永远也不会忘记的交谈.

The plan was that she would have chemotherapy following her surgery, and while I sat there with her, she suddenly said to me, “You know, with the chemo I'm going to lose my hair.” I replied, “It doesn't matter, you will always be beautiful to me.” She smiled back.

> 计划是在她手术之后还要进行化疗,在我坐在她身边的时候,她突然和我说,"在化疗的时候,我会掉光我的头发."我回答说,"没关系的,你在我眼里一直都那么漂亮." 她给了我一个大大的微笑.

She knew that her cancer was stage IV. The doctor said she also had two spots on her liver. Metastases. It actually turned out to be many more, eight or ten. She was very weak, as if close to death, but there is always that little glimmer of hope. One day when I sat with her, a nurse came into the room. Friends and family had decided it was best not to tell her just how many spots she had on her liver. It would only make a bad situation worse. The nurse did what she needed to do and suddenly blurted out to my friend something like, “And your liver is full of spots!” I could have just slapped the nurse in the face! My friend looked much more worried than before. You could see she was very affected by the nurse’s thoughtless comment. I think she gave up right there and then, she lived only a few more days.

> 她知道她的癌症已经是晚期了.那医生说她的肝脏还有感染的斑点.癌症转移.最后然后那里有更多,8 个或者 10 个感染点.她已经很虚弱了,但那里始终有着渺茫的希望.有一天,我坐在她旁边,护士走到病房里面.朋友和她的家人都决定不要告诉她,她的肝脏有多少感染.这只会让现在的情况更糟糕.那个护士做完了要做的事后,然后对我的朋友说,"你的肝脏全是感染的斑点了".我应该一巴掌打死那个护士的.我朋友看起来比往常更担忧了.你可以看见她被护士的话影响有多大.我想,那会她就放弃了,她还存活了几天.

My dear friend passed only two hours after I left her. I would have liked to stay, but I was too exhausted. I had to go home to sleep. I think she wanted it that way. The next day, I came to say goodbye. Even though her body was there, the room felt empty, as if her spirit had already left.

> 我的朋友在我离开的两个小时后去世了.我想留在那里,但我已经筋疲力尽了.我必须回家睡一觉.我想她也想我回去的.第二天,我去和她说永别.尽管她的身体还在那里,但那个房间感觉已经被清空,就像她精神早就离开了一样.

I traveled home. I was in a daze. I didn’t care whether or not the airplane crashed, I just wanted to be where she was.

> 我回到家.我有点茫然.我不在是不是坠机什么的,我只想去她去的地方.

And this is where it gets weird.

> 然后事情变得奇怪了起来.

Two weeks after her death, I got this intuitive feeling to put my finger deep into my vagina after a shower — and I suddenly found this lump about two cm or one inch! Cancer???! I decided not to fret, just called the doctor’s office for an appointment. The doctor could not find the lump, but sent me for a colonoscopy. I also saw a gynecologist. He said, “This is disconcerting, I don’t want to let this one go.”

> 在她去世的两周后,我有知觉在洗澡后我检查了一下我的子宫,我突然间发现一个 2 厘米或者一寸大的团块.癌症??? 我不能去烦躁,打电话预约医生.那个医生不能找到那个团块,但给我结镜检查.我同时还去看了妇科.他说,"这有点令人不安,我会好好检查这个的."

Long story short, it WAS a malignant tumor, in my colon. What I didn’t say before is that my friend had surgery not only to her reproductive organ, but also to her colon, which required resection.

> 长话短说,在我的结肠里面有一个恶性的肿瘤.我前面没说的是,我朋友在手术的时候步进切除了她的生殖器官,同时也对结肠进行了处理.

When I was told about my own cancer, I also learned that my liver was also affected, that I had two spots on my liver. Same thing as my friend had been told only three months before.

> 当我被告知我患有癌症的时候,我同时知道我的肝脏也受到了感染,那里有 2 个阴影在我的肝脏上面.就和我朋友三个月前的情况一模一样.

As I was trying to take in this news, my doctor continued to say that I also needed radiation and chemotherapy. “And count on losing your hair.” Another deja vu. I was thinking back on what my friend had said about losing her hair, the memory was still fresh in my mind.

> 在我尝试接受这个事实的时候,我的医生告诉我要进行放射治疗和化学治疗."这会掉光我的头发的."我回想起我朋友说她掉发的场景,那些场景还历历在目.

I started my treatment last August and went through a sh\*tload of side effects and still am 3/4th year later. I was in the hospital four times, for a total of two weeks. Two surgeries.

> 在上一年八月开始了我的治疗,在后面的日子里面熬过一系列的不良反应.我在两周里面进医院四次,2 次手术.

I think it was my friend who told me from the other side that I was sick. I really had no idea I had cancer.

> 我想这是我那个朋友托梦告诉我也病了.我之前都不知道我有癌症.

I understand everything that my friend went through because I lived through it too. It’s like I continued the journey where she left off.

> 我明白了我朋友的处境,也同时自己经历过了.看来,我还得继续她还没完成的旅程了.

I am a spiritualist, I believe in an afterlife. I also believe that humans are given exit points to leave this life, but I chose not to. I'm still here. I don't know if I survive this, but I hope I do. That is my goal. My friend has given me the strength to fight.

> 我是唯心论的人,我相信 after life(来生?).我同时也相信每个人的一生都有一个退出的电,而我选择了不退出.我还在这里.我不知道能不能活下去,但我希望我可以.这也是我的目标.我的朋友给了我去抗战的力量.

My friend group consisted of a trio, and we were inseparable.

> 我的朋友圈里面包含了一个三人组,然后我们三个形影不离.

About 2 years ago, one of our trio got diagnosed with cancer. He put up a really strong fight, but passed away about 6 months ago.

> 在 2 年前,其中一个人被诊断为癌症.他很顽强的和癌症抗争,但还是在 6 个月前去世了.

That night, I had a dream. The 3 of us were on a public bus, sitting and talking. We sat back and laughed at all the crazy things we had done, especially the things the one that passed did. Towards the very end of the dream he leaned in and said “thank you guys for being my friends. I couldn’t have asked for anything better.”

> 那晚,我做了一个梦.我们三个在一辆公交车上面,坐在一起相互交谈这.我们坐在公交车后面,笑着我们之间做过疯狂的事,特别是去世的那个朋友之间做过的疯狂的事.在梦快结束的时候,他靠着椅子说,"谢谢你们作为我的朋友,我不能要求更多了."

I woke up, and didn’t give it a ton of thought. I wasn’t surprised I had a dream about him, he had just passed away the day before. I did question why we were on a public bus. Interestingly enough, none of us had never ridden a bus together in our entire friendship.

> 我醒来,然后也没怎么留意这个梦.我对梦到他觉得并不意外,他一天前才刚刚去世.我的确对我们在公交车有点疑惑.因为我们三个从来没有一起坐过公交车.

I met up with my other friend that day, and it was a very somber time. Until I mentioned the dream I had the night before. My friend turned pale as a ghost. He had had the exact same dream. The 3 of us on the bus talking.

> 我那天和另一个朋友聚了一下,我们之间都很沉闷.直到我提到我昨晚的那个梦.我朋友忽然脸色苍白.他有着同样的一个梦.我们三个在公交车上交谈.

We went back and forth to make sure the other wasn’t lying. We traded off walking the other one through the dream. It was identical. We had both had the same dream, word for word. Location, subjects of conversation, everything.

> 我们要确保对方没有撒谎.我们相互给对方叙述了各自的梦境.两个梦竟然一模一样.我们做了同一个梦,对话,地点,谈论的东西,任何东西都一样.

At that moment, this Agnostic got a pretty big dash of religion in his body.

> 在那一刻,宗教的东西在一个不可知论的人的身体里面翻江倒海.

## 人的哪些品质被严重低估了?

From: [What is the single most underrated trait a person can have?](http://qr.ae/TUpvKC)
Date: June 12 2018

Back when I was a student in university, there was a guy in my class named Sima.

> 回到我的大学时代,我有一个男同学叫 Sima.

Sima was really funny. In my opinion, he was one of the funniest people I’ve ever met.

> Sima 是一个很有趣的人.我认为,他是我遇到最有趣的人之一.

There are some comedians who spend hours and hours every single day writing content in hopes of building up a reputation, but Sima was the kind of guy who randomly said the right thing at the right time, and the entire classroom would blow up in euphoric laughter.

> 那些喜剧演员每天花费大量的时间去写段子,好建立他们自己的名望,但 Sima 是那种在不经意间就在合适的时间做了合适的事的人,然后整一间教室都笑了.

There wasn’t a time when you’d look at Sima, and would not see a smile on his face. He was also the kind of guy to go talk to, the quiet kid in the corner when everyone else would just kind of assume the reason that no one was sitting with him was because there was something wrong with him.

> 如果你望向 Sima,你会发现他每一刻都是在笑的.他还是那种和待在角落里面同学交谈的人,那些安静的同学,即使没有任何不正常的地方也有人不想和他们相处的同学.

I didn’t really hear a lot about him, but the guy had a pure heart. One of the things which shocked me the most was one time when we were talking about WWII, and I said that I hoped Adolf Hitler was rotting in hell.

> 我没太了解他,但他的确有善良的内心.给我最深的一次震惊的是在我们讨论二战的时候,我说希特勒应该在地狱里面受罚.

He then went on to tell me that I was wrong for saying such a thing. He said no soul deserves to go through eternal torment. He said that it was the worst crime you could ever impose on someone, and that it was even worse than all the genocide which Hitler was responsible for. Sima was also Jewish, that’s what shocked me the most about the way he looked at things.

> 然后他走到我旁边,告诉我说这种事是错的.他说没有灵魂要为自己的罪行而一直被惩罚的.这是你能给别人加上最坏的罪行了,这甚至比希特勒的种族屠杀更加坏.Sima 还是犹太人,他看待事物的方式让我感到吃惊.

The thing about Sima was that none of us really knew anything about him. As much as all of us loved him, he was just “there”. None of us knew him, he didn’t know any of us. I would never see him at any parties or get togethers. I wouldn’t even see him in the city after class.

> 关于 Sima,我们没有一个人了解他.就算我们所有人都喜欢他,他就在那里.但是我们没有一个人了解他,他也没有了解我们任一个.我从没看见他出现在聚会或者团体活动里面.在下课之后,我甚至没在城市里面见过他.

One day, an armed gunman ran into our class with a pistol and started firing rounds. I believe it hit one kid in the shoulder, but before he could do any more damage, Sima jumped out of his seat and lunged at him. They wrestled for a couple of seconds, and then the gunman shot Sima in the stomach as he tried to pull the gun away from him. Literally everyone in the classroom had jumped up to attack the gunman before he could harm anyone else, and we disarmed him.

> 那天,一个持枪 er 跑进我们的教室,然后开始扫射.我相信有一个小屁孩的肩膀被子弹打中了,但在他能造成更大的伤害的时候,Sima 从他的座位里面跳起来,直接跑向他.他们纠缠了一会,在 Sima 尝试推开那个持枪者的时候,那个持枪的人在 Sima 的腹部开了一枪.一会之后,在那个持枪人还没伤害其他人之前,班上所有的人都跳起来,跑去袭击那个持枪的人,我们收缴了他的枪.

Sima saved all of us. I froze when the gunman walked into the room, but Sima fearlessly attacked him.

> Sima 救了我们全部人.我在持枪人走进教室的那会都被惊呆了,但 Sima 勇敢的去抵抗他.

I watched Sima lay on the floor with blood gushing out of the bullet wound in his stomach, he gasped for a couple of breaths, and then died right before our eyes.

> 我看着 Sima 躺在教室的地板上,血从他的伤口处涌出来.他气若游丝的喘了一会,然后他就在我们眼前离去了.

I instantly fell to the floor, and I put my fingers on his neck to check the pulse.

> 我立刻趴在地板上,把我的手指放在他的脖子上,检查他的脉搏.

I felt nothing.

> 但我一点也没感受到他的脉搏.

Then I rolled up his sleeve to check the pulse on his wrist, and what I saw scarred me for life…

> 然后我卷起他的衣袖,检查他手腕处的脉搏,然后我看见了我一生中最恐怖的画面...

He had cuts and scars all over his arm. I didn’t believe my eyes. It was as if he had been tearing apart his arm with a knife on a daily basis. I was surprised I had never noticed it before. His arm was literally like one giant scar.

> 他的手臂全都是切割的伤疤.我都不敢相信我看见的东西.那就像他每天都用刀在他手臂上划的痕迹.我很惊讶,为什么我之前一点也没留意到.他的手臂完全就像一个大的伤疤.

After class, the authorities searched his apartment while looking for evidence, and they found his diary which they gave to my professor as a sign of courtesy the next day.

> 在课后,政府人员搜查了他的公寓,寻找证据,然后他们发现了他的日志,他们第二天就礼貌的转交给我们的教授了.

Apparently, Sima had no family. Sima had no friends. Sima studied during the day, and worked for hours and hours of manual labor for the rest of the day.

> 显然,Sima 没有家庭.Sima 没有朋友,Sima 在学校的这一段时间,他需要每天都繁重的工作.

Sima was alone, depressed, and he was also suicidal. He literally wrote in his diary almost everyday of the self-harm which he had been committing on his body. Cutting his wrists, punching himself in stomach, banging his head against the wall, the list goes on…

> Sima 孤独而又忧郁,同时也自杀了.他最近写他的日志写到他每天都会自残.割腕,击打自己的胃部,以头抢地,一系列的自残行为....

He wrote that he drank himself to sleep every night.

> 他写到他必须每晚喝酒才能睡着.

He wrote in his diary that he was just hoping that he would die, but he just couldn’t bring himself to commit suicide.

> 他在日志写到他希望他自己可以挂掉,但他自己又不能够自杀.

So when the gunman came into our classroom, he didn’t hesitate to lunge himself into a certain death to save all of us.

> 所以,当那个持枪人出现在我们教室的时候,他一点也没迟疑就冲向了他,为了保护我们而让自己给干掉.

He just wanted everyone to be happy. He had nothing to live for, and none of us even knew. Judging by the way he acted, we all thought he must have been living a great life for him to be so happy all the time. But no. He was actually the most miserable person in the classroom.

> 他只是想其他人开心一点.他连活下去的依靠都没有,然而我们没有一个知道.在他之前的行为来看,我们以为他有着不错的生活,一直以来都很幸福.但没有呀.他才是我们班里面最悲惨的那个人.

He was in no way underrated because the heavens simply would not allow such a selfless person’s story to go untold. He was only underrated when he was alive.

> 他不会被人低估的,因为我们不允许他的故事就这样沉默了.他只有在他活着的时候被低估了.

It taught me to stop trying to be alpha. It taught me to stop trying to be rich. It taught me to stop trying to be the “winner” in life.

> 这让我不再去争取都头头.让我停止去变有钱.让我停止尝试去当人生赢家.

Because if it wasn’t for Sima, I probably would not have even been in the race…

> 但如果不是 Sima 的话,我可能早就挂掉了.

There are no winners or losers in life. Sima taught me to just live your life and try to see the best in people. I think every single person in my classroom changed that day for the better. Sima was a martyr unlike anyone else I have ever heard of. And I have seen a lot of bloodshed.

> 在生活里面,没有输家和赢家.Sima 教会我要去生活,而且要看他人好的一面.我想,从那一天起,我们班的人都尝试去让自己变得更好.Sima 不像我之前听过那些一样牺牲了.而我看见一堆的血.

Selflessness is definitely underrated because you don’t realize it until the selfless person is gone. But unlike how rich someone was, your memory of their selflessness will last forever.

> 无私是最被低估的品质了.因为在你意识到后,无私的人就离去了.不像那种有钱人的离去,你关于他们无私的记忆将会终生记得.

## 和 ta 的最后一条信息

From: [What was the last text message you sent to your ex?](http://qr.ae/TUpybS)
Date: June 13 2018

I'm going anonymous because my mom is on Quora and so is my ex but I care more about the drama from my mom. My ex would probably know it's me because of the conversation I'm going to write down.

> 我匿名是因为我妈和我前任都在 Quora 上,但我更担心是我妈的不依不饶.前任应该知道这个是我,因为会把信息写到这上面来.

I'm a 26 years old man and she is 23 years old woman. I stay in Bombay and she stays in Ahmedabad. She was my college junior and we had noticed each other back then but didn't talk at all.

> 我是一个 26 的老人,而她 23.我待在孟买,她在 Ahmedabad(又是印度).她是我的学妹,然我们都留意到对方,但我们都没有主动去联系对方.

We had a pretty amazing start to our long distance relationship but soon it turned into insecure push and pull relationship. She would run away, block me from social media and calls, pretend to sleep with other men to show me that she is cheating and all the drama of “You deserve someone better”. It was a crazy emotional drama.

> 我们有一个很惊艳的异地恋的开头,然后成了狗血剧.她想逃离,然后把我拉黑掉了,无论是社交还是电话.假装和隔壁老王睡了,告诉我她一直都是在欺骗我,所有的都是在发好人卡.那简直宫系列的狗血剧.

We met twice after our 9 months long long-distance relationship. We never met while we were in relationship. Second time we met, she shouted in front of the whole public in crowded Cafe by blaming me for things I never did. I went back home while crying in the local train.

> 我们在 9 个月的异地恋里面,见过两次面.我们在我们恋爱的时候从来没见过面.第二次,我们相遇,是因为她在一家咖啡馆外边的人群里面大声责骂着我从来没做过的事.我在回家的路上,留下了一如既往的泪水.

After all this we had a small talk kinda chat few times. She still is in Ahmedabad and I'm in Mumbai.

> 在经历过这些后,我们还会偶尔交谈一下.她还在那里,我也还在这里.

One day I saw her Instagram story with booze and I replied, “Have a good time”.

> 有一天,我看见她的 Ins 展示了酒席,然后我评论,"玩得开心一点,窝草".

She: Yes. I will. Juhu has its own vibe. (Juhu is a place in Mumbai and it was her way of telling me that she is in Mumbai).

> 她: 会的.我会的.我现在在孟买.(她用她的方式告诉我她在孟买)

All the emotions rushed through me of how she can't tell me that she is in Mumbai and why is she telling me now. Will she ask me to meet? Should I meet her? Should I tell her to work out things again. But I knew there was no point after all the emotional drama last time.

> 一阵不可抑制的复杂感情涌起心头,为什么她不告诉我她在孟买了,那她为什么现在告诉我.她会叫我去见她吗?我应该去见她吗?我们要复合吗?但我知道经过那些狗血剧之后,复合是不可能的了,这辈子都不可能符合的.

Me: Indeed. Check out Versova beach and Yaari road. They are pretty cool.

> 我: 哈.要记得去 xx 海滩和解放路.那些地方很漂亮的.

She: Sure. I thought You'll ask me to meet but it's okay.

> 她: 会的.我还以为你想叫我去见你,还好没有.

I realised she is just trying to make me crave for her again so she can play games.

> 我意识她想让我再次跪给自己,然后她好开始演戏.

Me: No. I don't think I want to meet you. Have a good time.

> 我: 还是算了吧.我要忙了.玩得开心.

She: Thanks.

> 她: 谢谢.

I felt so much better after this. I never imagined myself being so strong in front of her. I was feeling amazingly happy that I decided not to be a puppet anymore.

> 在这之后,我神清气爽.我从来没想过在她面前可以这么勇敢.我感到好开心,因为我不用当别人的宠物了,我就是我,一条烟火一样的单身狗.

An illiterate guy I knew desperately asked me to teach mathematics to his 16-year-old son who couldn’t multiply two one-digit numbers and was months away from failing his 16+ exams - he was at a below-average state school and was doing pretty badly there.

> 我认识的一个文盲绝望的请求我去教他 16 岁儿砸的数学,那个不能计算两位小数,离他高考之后一个月的儿砸,他是学校里面的差生,还是学校里面很差的那种.

I agreed to his father's request, but I didn’t teach the kid any mathematics. Every week I just spent 15 minutes telling him and then reminding him that unless he sorted his life out he’d be cooking burgers for the rest of his life.

> 我同意了他父亲的请求,但我没有教那个小屁孩一点数学的东西.每一个星期,我都会花 15 分钟告诉他,提醒他,除非他自己处理好自己的人生,不然他以后只能卖汉堡了.

I explained in detail what that actually meant. Apart from hating his job he’d be driving home in a 20-year-old Datsun to his tiny house, he wouldn’t be able to give his kids things that he’d want to give them, etc…

> 我给他详细的解释了卖汉堡的意思.除了他会讨厌他的工作,开着一辆 20 年的车回到他那微小的家,他不能给他的小屁孩任何他想要给的东西,大概都是这类东西...

And it would, in all probability, be too late to do anything about it, in part because he’d be mentally defeated.

> 很有可能,现在做什么都已经迟了,因为他精神上很挫败.

I did tell him there’s nothing wrong living an honest life like that. In fact, it’d be admirable if he could contently do so. But he’s actively making a choice that will, in all probability, lead him there.

> 我告诉他,这样诚实的活着是没有错的.事实上,如果他对自己足够诚实,这还是值得称赞的一件事.但他必须要按照自己的意愿做出选择,尽所有可能,走到那里.

Just over five years later he graduated from King's College London, one of the top 25 universities in the world, in Computer Science.

> 5 年后,他从皇家理工学院的计算机系毕业了,那可是世界上 top25 的大学呀.

My former father-in-law is one of the best human beings I’ve ever met. We may not speak much anymore since my divorce, but I will always hold him in high regard.

In the near 20 years that he was an integral part of my life, he never once-not once- spoke of the good deeds he did for people. And he did a lot of them.

He’d house-sit for us while we were on a week’s vacation. Months later, I’d gradually notice little changes around the house. The broken lamp we’d been meaning to repair was suddenly working. The greying paint in the bathroom was suddenly brighter. The carpet stain beside the coffee table was no longer there.

> 在我们休假的时候,他会帮我们看守房子.一个月后,我留意到房子有了小小的改变.那烂掉的水槽被修好而且能工作了.浴室里面灰暗的色调变明亮了.那块在咖啡桌旁边满是污迹的地毯不见了.

He will learn the pains of paying interest of a loan, and after this winter, he’s learning the pains of losing money and having to start over again!

> 他会了解到利息的蛋疼,在冬天后,他会了解到折损和重新开始.

Most importantly, I’m teaching and developing his mindset! Entrepreneurship is an art, an understanding of how to make money, it needs to be learned, not taught.

## 一个备胎的自述

From: [What has been the roughest moment in life?](http://qr.ae/TUpDgt)
Date: July 02 2018

& there…. In the washroom I for the very first time opened her phone & what I saw shook the world beneath me.

> 嗯,是这样子的.在厕所里面,我第一次解锁她手机的时候,我感到了整一个宇宙的震动.

She bad been my cursh since 8th Standard. After being friendzoned since, 4 years subsequent we were in a very deep relationship. Since we both belonged to a conservative society it is here difficult to even meet once a month, but we managed to do it thrice or sometimes more than that a week.

> 在八年级的时候,我就开始暗恋她了.在经历了所谓的朋友期之后,我们有了 4 年的狗血偶像剧.我们处于比较严谨的社交里面,我们甚至一个月也没聚一次,但我们总能找到方法一个星期聚上三四次.

I used to save money only for her, just to give her a fancy gift, taking her to a decent restaurant, decent gifts only so that she can feel special. Since I knew how much time & temper it took all those years just to get her, I used to protect her like a flower & treat her as a queen. Giving up after all arguments, fights & everything just so that I may not loose her. She also loved me(at least that was she said).

> 我经常省钱,为了给她买一件礼物,带她去好的餐馆,得体的礼物让她觉得自己是在乎她的.在追她的这些年里面,我知道我花了多少时间和心思,我过去就像小王子一样, 把她当做我的皇后.对于那些相互之间的争吵,因为害怕失去她,我一一妥协.她也是喜欢我的(至少她是这么告诉我的).

TWO YEARS AFTER BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP I CAUGHT HER CHEATING ON ME & THE WAY I CAUGHT HER WAS QUITE A VERY UNNATURAL MOVIE SOME SCENE.

> 在交往两年后,我找到了她劈腿的证据.我找到这个证据的时候就像一些电影里面的场景.

I never asked for her passwords, her phones or anything. Never wanted to make her feel uncomfortable. But since she used to sit right besides the driver seat I somehow unintentionally saw her phone pattern one day. Even that didn't made me unconscious because I trusted her. One day I parked my car near a public washroom telling her that the engine is heating up. Borrowed her phone to have the led light to watch the engine. I took her phone to the washroom to fill up the water bottle for my engine.

> 我从来没有问她要过密码,她的手机或者其他任何东西.从来不想让她感到不舒服.但自从她坐在副驾驶的位置,有一次我不小心看到了她的密码.即使这样子,我也没起疑心,因为我相信她.有一天我把车停在公共厕所旁边,告诉她引擎过热了,借她的手机开灯来看看引擎的情况.我将她的手机拿到厕所里面,用瓶子装水到引擎里面.

& there…. In the washroom I for the very first time opened her phone & what I saw shook the world beneath me.

> 然后,就是这一刻,我第一次打开他的手机.然后我看到了何等的窝草.

We were having issues since 3,4 months. Serious fights & all but end of the day I used to give up & things kept on dragging. I used to cry madly for her, & kept on doing any shitty thi ng just to please her. I was an example amongst my friends on how loyal & loving a boy should be towards his girl. & vice versa in her girls on how an ideal boy one should have.

> 我们之间存在问题 3-4 个月了.那天吵了一架,我还是和往常一样放弃了,继续拖着.我之前为她哭得可凶了.做那些任何让她可以变得高兴的事.我是我朋友间的模范男友,在女朋友生气的时候,男朋友该怎么处理的优秀模板.

She had been sexting with one of her coaching teacher who became friends with her just 4 months prior. They were exchanging inappropriate pictures, kept on meeting & had been physical already. The phone was full of such photos of them. I had never ever asked her for any sexual photo thou we had a physcial relation but I tried never to do any inappropriate thing before getting married.

> 她和她在四个月前认识的男教练发调情信息.他们交换艳照,偶尔出墙,已经出墙了,现在.手机里面全是那些照片.我从没问过她要过裸照什么的,尽管我们之间存在了关系,但我不想在结婚前,要她任何不适的照片.

I came back. Not knowing how to even walk coming from the washroom. Sitting in the car. Drove it to another place. Stopped it. Had tears in my eyes & asked her,

> 我走回去.甚至不知道怎么走回车里面.坐在车里面,开到其他的地方.停在那里.泪流满面的质询她.

You know I've always trusted you. I fear that you don't trust me for these few months. You've been acting weird. What's the problem baby. Am I starting to hurt you already?

> 你知道我一直相信的.我害怕你不相信我的这些日子里面.你变了.为什么会变成现在这样.我很早就开始让你感到灰心了吗?

NOOO! Who said such? You're a man every girl dreams of. I can never even think of you being with anyone else. I'll kill that woman. You're mine forever. Don't you worry I’m all yours.

> 没呀.谁说的?你是每一个女孩子的白马王子.我甚至不能想象你和别的人在一起.我会把那些女孩子干掉的.你永远都是我的.不要担心,我全是你的.

After her words, I showed her her phone & the pictures, I remember for the very first time in my life I abused horribly & started shouting at her. This is what you call loyalty. This is how your parents have raised you. You're a whore. & tons & tons of abuses. She started crying. Held me forcefully asking for forgiveness but that was the very time I stood for myself. & threw her out of the car in the middle of the city. I had completely lost my cool that day.

> 在她说这些后,我给她看了在她手机里面的照片,那一刻我记起了小时后所有受过的委屈,开始骂她了.这就是你 tmd 忠于对方.这就是你父母这么教养你的(这就有点过分了).你是绿茶婊.一堆,一堆,一堆的粗口.她开始哭了.抱着我请求原谅,但这一次我没有.我把她扔在银河系的边缘.告诉你哦,那天我一点也不酷.

She kept messaging me, used to call me at 4-5 am. Crying that she cannot sleep. She's sorry but I ignored & even went harsh on her on messages.

> 她一直给我发消息,4-5 点给我电话.哭着说她失眠.她很抱歉,但我忽略了她.尽管还时不时 look back.

It's been two years now & I've progressed miraculously. I cannot believe it myself. When she used to be around I was never able to focus on any other subject rather than love & her. & have learnt a very valuable lesson in life.

> 现在已经两年了,我过得挺好.我都有点不相信我自己.当她在身边的时候,我从来都没能专注于其他的东西,除了喜欢她.现在开始找到了生活的意义.

Some things in life are not at all in your control, you can try to do so but if it's difficult, one should let it be.

> 生活里面,你不能控制所有的变量,你可以尝试去做,但这很困难,但一生也要那么一次去做的.

My uncle got cheated on by his wife of 20 years. The divorce was ugly. The whole family was pulled into the fray. Both his kids were in college, so they were spared the nastiness.

> 我叔叔被她老婆戴了 20 多年的绿帽.离婚的时候也一地鸡血.整一个家庭都陷入纷争里面.他的两个小屁孩都上大学了,所以他们免受这些肮脏的撕扯.

Even before the divorce was finalized, the wife went around town, remorseless, flaunting her lover. It was scandalous. My uncle was so ashamed he refused to leave the house except for his job, and opted out of all family events. He became depressed and suicidal.

> 在最终离婚定下来之前,他的老婆就在厚颜无耻的诋毁叔叔了.那些太恶心人了.我叔叔因为那些诽谤赶到很惭愧,除了工作他都待在那间屋子里面,并退出了所有的家庭活动.他变得阴沉和有自杀倾向.

One day our house phone rang. Father picked it up. My uncle was crying and holding a gun to his head. My father convinced him to put it down while I dialed the helpline.

> 有一天我们家的电话响了.我爸拿起电话.我叔叔在哭着,用着枪指着自己的头部.我爸在我给求组热线打电话的时候,劝他把枪放下.

We arranged an intervention and convinced him to get therapy. This helped. In one of his groups, he made a friend named Felicia. Toothy grin and wild red hair. She changed him completely. It wasn't long before they were dating. In a year, they were married. Felicia really wanted kids of her own. They tried for two years until she finally became pregnant.

> 我们安排了一次调停,劝他去治疗一下.治疗起到了作用.在那个治疗队伍里面,他遇到了一个叫 Felicia 的人,一个爱笑的,有着红头发的女性.她改变了他.他们甚至都没约会多久.一年后,他们就结婚了.Felicia 想有一个小屁孩.他们尝试了两年后,她终于怀孕了.

They were so happy. My uncle would share updates of his wife's health, ultrasound pictures, the nursery they were setting up in an old gym room and spending shitloads of money on. One day, eight months in, he comes home to find his wife on the floor. She was bleeding. That's how I saw him that day when we reached the hospital: in a white shirt stained red with his wife's blood.

> 他们很开心.我叔叔会在和我们分享他妻子的健康情况,超声波的照片.他们花了大量的去把旧的健身房改造成小屁孩的房子.一天,在小屁孩八个月的时候,他回家发现了躺在地板上的妻子.她在流血.这就是我们那天到医院看见的情景:他白色的衬衫上面沾满了他妻子的血迹.

Until the day I die I will never forget his face, his drawn eyes.

> 我死也不会忘记那天我叔叔的表情,他全是绝望的眼神.

For 10 hours, the doctors worked to save both the wife and baby. Failing that, six hours more to save only the dying wife. When the doctor came out and told my uncle the sad news, he just crumpled on the chair behind him. A day before, he was the cheeriest man alive. Now he'd lost both of them.

> 经过 10 小时的抢救,医生想保住大人和小屁孩.这失败了,然后 6 个小时在抢救那个正在迈向死亡的妻子.但医生出来告诉他那个悲痛的消息的时候,他直接倒在了他身后的椅子上.一天前,他还算是一个幸福的男人.现在他失去了所有.

I looked at my father, who had told him a forever ago, things will get better, I promise.He was standing next to my uncle with his hand on his shoulder, completely at a loss for words.

> 我看着我老爸,那个曾告诉叔叔日子会变好的,我向你保证.他站在我叔叔的身旁,而一句安慰的话也说不出.

In that moment, I knew that Everything happens for a reason it is the shittiest philosophy of life there is. Life is random, happiness is fleeting, and hope? Hope is probably the most sadistic bitch out there.

> 在那一刻,我知道:所有的事发生都是有缘由的,是最操蛋无脑的话了.生活是无常的,幸福是短暂的,而希望呢?希望才是最贱的那个.

## 完美婚姻

My grandparents are married for 65 years now.

> 我爷爷奶奶结婚 65 年了,到现在.

Granny has weak legs, and Grandpa chokes food. Even if her whole body tremors, she walks up to the kitchen when grandpa’s home. Sits next to him with water in her hands while he’s eating. She doesn’t want anybody to do that except her.

> 奶奶有一条腿不行,而爷爷吃饭容易被噎到.尽管她身体不好,她在爷爷在家的时候都会去到厨房里面.在他吃东西的时候,坐在他的身边,把一杯水放在他手上.她除了自己不想让其他人做这件事.

Then, he holds her hand supporting her steps to bed.

> 然后,爷爷会拉住奶奶的手,扶她去睡觉.

Every time he chokes, she rushes in her weak legs. “ You’ve to be careful, I won’t always be there to get you water.” - She says.

> 每一次他噎住了,她都会拖着她的病腿去拿水."你要小心一点呀,我不能一直给你拿水的." 她说.

Every time she falls, he rushes to her. Picks her up, and says “Don’t you worry, you’ve got a strong man.”

> 每一次她跌倒,他也会冲向她.把她扶起来,然后说"不要怕,我在你身边."

## 关于婚姻的看法

I was happily married for 15 years and discovered in the course of my marriage that just like my husband inspired in me wonderful things I would have never come to be without him, he also, perhaps in equal measure, suppressed other parts of me that could not develop in his company.

> 我很开心结婚了 15 年之后,然后离婚了,在我的婚姻里面,我的丈夫在某些方面激励了我,如果没有 ta,我是不可能做到,但同时,在同样的考量下,和他在一起也抑制了另一些东西的发展.

He was neither controlling nor limiting. He did not do this on purpose. This is the nature of relationships - the dynamic implicit in the interaction two people create encourages some things and atrophies others.

> 他没有控制和限制我的发展.他是无意的.这是两人关系里面最平常的了-两个人在某些事要一起经历,某些事上退宿,都会对各自产生自动的影响的.

When we got a divorce, I didn’t know very much about myself. I had so much of me to retrieve. Interests to follow, new aspects of me to discover, beliefs I arrived at that I could never get to through conversations with him.

> 在我们离婚后,我甚至不太了解我自己.我有太多的东西需要去重新拾回了.去追随感兴趣的东西啦,关于离婚的新看法啦,相信以后无论我做什么都不能和他一起讨论了.

Leaving him was one of the most sorrowful things I have ever been through, but it was also one of the most interesting and rewarding.

> 离开他是我经历过最伤心的一件事了,但这也是一件有趣和值得的事.

I have friends who ask me if I am happier now. I don't know if I am happier, but I do know that I feel more alive.

> 有朋友问我是否幸福现在.我不知道我算不算星都,但我的确知道我可以活得更自在一些.

This is no small thing.

> 这不是一件小事.

My father’s rule was simple.

> 我爸的规则很简单.

“If you start a fight, it doesn’t matter what the school does. I’m going to punish you worse than they ever could. If someone starts a fight with you, don’t worry about the school, fight back as best you can, I would never punish you for that. Never start a fight, never be afraid to finish a fight that someone else started with you.”

> "如果是你挑起的打架,不论学校对你做什么.我会把你打出屎来的.如果是别人打你的话,不要害怕学校,你尽力还击就好,我不会因为这个打你.不要挑起打架,但如果别人先打你的话,你也不要害怕."

A good lesson, I think. And one I intend to pass down to my children.

> 一个很好的理由,我想.我也想让我的孩子知道这个.

## 学生例假

The first year I was a teacher, this happened.

> 在我第一年当老师的时候,就发生了.

A kid came in at the start of my fourth period class and said, “Hey, there’s something on my chair.” We had maroon chairs, but it was immediately obvious to me that the stain on his chair seat was blood. Third period had left just moments ago, and I knew the student who’d been sitting there earlier — this teeny freshman girl wearing a skirt — and I doubted that she had any idea she’d started her period.

> 课前,一个小屁孩走进教室,然后说,"我的凳子上面有东西."我们有着褐色的凳子,但我很快就知道那凳子上面都是血.刚才第三节课刚下课没多久,而我刚好知道坐在那个凳子的学生是谁.那个瘦小刚转来的,穿着裙子的小女生,而且我怀疑她是不是还不知道任何关于她月经的事情.

Thinking fast, I said, “Wow, looks like someone spilled their nail polish. That sucks. Let’s put a towel over it. Anyway, Bob, sit in this other seat, and we’ll have this taken care of.” Meanwhile, I went to the back of the class and got a pair of sweat pants I’d stashed there for my own use. They were not the loveliest sweat pants, but they had two major advantages: They were black, and they were clean. After looking up the freshman girl’s schedule, I put the sweats in a bag, wrote a sealed note, and called over another student. “Take these to Mrs. Whatever in room XYZ. Tell her they’re for Student PDQ, and please give the student this note and this bag.”

> 脑袋光速运行,我说,"窝草,一定是谁把指甲油倒在上面了.这很脏,我们先把纸巾扔在上面盖住.不论怎样,Bob,坐在其他的凳子上面,我会来处理这些的."同时,我走出教室,去拿我自己的球衣,我自己穿的当然没有什么可爱的啦,但 ta 们都有一个好处就是: 他们全都是黑的,而且是干净的.看了新来那个小屁孩的课程之后,我把衣服装进一个袋子里面,然后写了一条密封的纸条,然后叫其他的学生,"帮我把这些东西带给在 xxx 教室的 Mrs. Whatever 老师.然后告诉她这些是给 PDQ 的东西,然后把这个纸条和袋子都给那个学生了.

The note said, “Dear Student PDQ. Please ask to go to the restroom and take this bag with you. You may need what’s in it. Please don’t worry about returning these, and I hope this helps.”

> 那个纸条说,"亲爱的,请要求去厕所,然后带上那个袋子.你要里面的东西.不要担心要怎么还回来,希望可以帮上你的忙."

The next day, she quietly thanked me — I could tell she was embarrassed, so I made it like it was no big deal. Hey, it happens.

> 第二天,她小声的和我道谢-我知道她有点难为情,所以我故意让她觉得这根本没什么.但,这些都发生了.

From that day on, I keep spare sweatpants and t-shirts in my room. It’s easy to find inexpensive sweats at Walmart, and I get t-shirts for various school occasions all the time. I never want someone to feel ashamed over what is a simple and normal bodily function. Even if not all of us have this function, all of our bodies have, at some point in our lives, probably been the source of embarrassment in one way or another. If a ten-buck pair of Walmart sweats can make someone’s life a little better, it’s a worthy investment.

> 从那天起,我总是把一些空闲的衣物扔在我的办公司里面.很简单就在沃尔玛里面找到一个不贵的球衣,我把衬衣也用来应对这种时间.我从来不想 ta 们因为自己的身体功能而感到羞耻.尽管我们不是所有人都有这个机能,也不是我们全部人都有的,但在我们生活里面,这可能会成为 ta 们感到羞耻的一个原因.如果 10 美元就可以买到的沃尔玛可以帮 ta 们更好的度过一点的话,那还是值得的.

**Edited to add**: THANK YOU for all of the kind thoughts and responses. I truly appreciate all of the warm-hearted things people said. Wow, I’m blown away!

## 最甜的狗粮

Going Anonymous because my Mom uses Quora regularly and I've still not confessed her about my love!

> 我匿名是因为我老妈也经常晃在 Quora 上面,而我还不想因为我的爱情也让她困扰.

Let me tell you a brief background:

> 给你们一点背景介绍:

We were just friends in class 9th and later became kind of BFFs in 10th. Then I went to Kota for JEE preparation and she stayed back! I cleaned JEE and she got admitted to a local college. We again got connected through social media and after a chit chat for about 1–2 years and having almost 4–5 meetings, I decided to propose her.

> 我们在 9 年级的时候都还是朋友而已,然而在 10 年级的时候,我们就成为了 BFFs(Best firend forever).我去 Kota 准备 JEE 的考试,然后她留在了那里.我通过了 JEE,她也可以在本地的大学的录取.我们通过社交平台 chit chat 再次取得联系,在联系了 1-2 年后,大概我们见了 4-5 次面,我觉得向她告白.

The propose story:

> 这就是我们的故事:

As I mentioned that we were BFFs so there was nothing hidden from her. I came hometown (same town of hers) for winter holidays. I decided and planed everything from past few weeks. I started giving hints that I'm in love with someone. I never took name in chats neither went deep. But that hint is enough. One day she finally asked whether I love someone or what, I could observe a little cry inside her coz I knew that she also loves me.

> 在我说到我们是最好的朋友的时候,所以我没什么东西能藏得开她.我去到城镇里面(和她同一个城镇里面)度冬天的假日.我在前几个星期决定和计划所有的东西.我开始给出我喜欢某个人的暗示.我从来没告诉她是谁,在聊天里面,也没透露过多的消息.但那些暗示已经足够了.有一天,她终于问我是不是喜欢谁了,我甚至可以听到她内心哭泣的声音了,因为我知道她喜欢我呀.(草)

Now, the day came. I called her and said that today I am going to tell you my crush name. We met at a CCD and she was quite tensed. As soon I met her she asked me her name. I told her that the name of that girl is “Addu”. I started describing the beauty of addu. I spoken about addu's eyes, hairs, smile, intelligence, etc…i could observe that she was about to cry but she was silent and numb.

> 现在那天来了.我打电话给她,说今天我打算和你说出我喜欢的那个人是谁了.我们在 CCD 里面碰面,她有点紧张.在我们碰面一会,她就开始问我喜欢的是谁了.我告诉她那个女孩子叫 Addu.我开始描述我的想象力有多么漂亮了.我谈起 Addu 的眼睛啦,头发啦,笑容啦,还 tmd 很聪明,等等等等.我甚至留意她到差不多快哭了,但她很安静的待在那里.

Now the twist came, I lost my phone suddenly and said her to ring on my number. She took out her phone and dailed my number. That phone ringed in my blazer's pocket. I took out that phone and said, “Look, who's calling?”. It was her call with name written as “Addu”.

> 现在开始较量了.我把我的手机弄丢了,然后请她帮忙打一下我的号码.她拿出她的手机,然后打我的电话.那个电话在我的口袋里面想起来了.我拿出手机然后说,"你看,谁打电话来了."我把她的名字,在我手机上备注位 Addu.

You can only imagine that sudden change of mood on her face. Wish I could have a camera to capture her lovely reaction.

> 你可以想象突然间,她的心情变好了.要是当时有相机拍到她的脸就好了.

By the way, She is now is girlfriend, BFF and going to be wife coz we've decided to meet each other's parents next week.

> 随便说一下,现在她是我的女朋友了.BFF 然后要变成我老婆了,因为我们决定下个星期去见家长了.
