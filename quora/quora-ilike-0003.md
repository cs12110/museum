Date: February 08 2018

My 3 year old son is on Cloud nine today...So am I!!!!

> 今天,我三岁的孩子爽到飞天....我也是呀.

My husband and I are working professionals who spend 10–11 hours in office with 2–3 hours in Bangalore traffic. As a family, we hardly spend time on weekdays.

> 我和我的丈夫有着全职工作,每天花费 10-11 个小时在办公司里面,然后 2-3 小时花费在交通上.作为一个家庭,我们几乎在工作时间很难聚在一起.

We have a son, Agasthya, who is 3 years old and goes to play school. He is dropped and picked up from school by the caretaker, and she takes care of him throughout the day until I am back from office.

> 我们有一个小屁孩,A,他三岁了,现在正在上幼儿园.他上下课都是被保姆接送的,然后她会照顾他一整天,知道我从下班回来.

One day Agasthya comes up to me with a request "Amma, will you come to school today to pick me?" I was not surprised by his request because I know how he feels when he sees his friends' parents in the school and never gets to see his. I felt bad for not doing justice to parenthood. But with a convincing tone i cuddled him and said "I will come ONE day to pick you".

> 一天,A 走到我身边,然后提出了请求"Mom,你今天愿意到学校接送我吗?" 我对他提出这个请求一点也不奇怪,因为我知道他看着他的朋友的父母而没看见自己的父母在的感觉.我为了我没尽到父母的责任而感到内疚.但我用说服的语气,我抱着他说:"会的,有一天,我会去接你的".(窝草,这是何等的 flag,导演,导演,导演,你的...)

It was almost a month now, we had this discussion and I totally forgot about the promise I made to my son.

> 到现在都差不多了一个月了,我都忘记了我们之间的交谈了,也忘记了我对他许下的承诺.

Today I was feeling tired to go to work and decided to take off. By this time my son had left home to school.

> 今天我对工作感到疲倦,所以我请假休息了.这会,我儿子离开家门去上学了.

11.15 am today - I go to school to pick him up. I asked the watchman to send my son. Gate opens and my son comes out. He was surprised, astonished and joyous to see me waiting for him. I opened my arms to hug him, but he ran back to the gate where his teacher was standing, and with great joy, he says,

> 今天早上 11 点,我去学校接他.我问保安我要接我的孩子.门打开之后,我的孩子走出来了.他很惊讶,吃惊和很高兴的看到我在等着他.我张开手臂抱着他,然后他竟然,又拍回去了他老师站在的那个地方,带着大大的愉悦,他说,

"Ma'am today is ONE day. My mom has come to pick me"

> "老师,老师,老师,今天是 ONE day,我妈来接我回家了"

and then turns towards group of his friends and repeats the same. I did never see him so happy.

> 然后又跑到他朋友那里,重复着这句话.我从没看他这么开心过.

Then his teacher says that ever since the last one month, the first question he asks everyday when he comes to school is " Is Today Zero day or One day?" Having no clue why he asks such a question she has always replied "Today is Zero day." Even this morning she had answered him, "Today is Zero day."

> 然后他老师说,最近一个月以来,他来到学校问的第一个问题就是"今天是 Zore day 还是 One day?",我们不知道他为什么会问这个问题,然后她一直回复是"今天是 Zore day."即使在今天,她也是这么回复的,"今天是 Zore day."

I had tears in my eyes realising how my son was waiting for this ONE day. All the way to home he was jumping and Singing - Today is ONE day

> 意识到他是怎么等待这个 One day 的时候,我泪湿眼底.回家的一路上,他都在跳呀,唱呀-今天是 One day

So innocent kids are!!!!

> 多么傻的小屁孩!!!!(是呀,有保姆就比别的高出不知多少了)

Me and Dad returned home with two shopping bags in hand. Mom looked at us and asked what’s in the second bag.

## 别人对你做过最糟糕的事?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the most messed up thing that someone has done to you?](http://qr.ae/TgbJxx)

Date: February 27 2018

I wish I didn’t have to write this anonymously, but I don’t want my son to read this and know what happened.

> 我希望可以不匿名的写出这个,但我不想我的儿子看到这个,从而知道发生了什么事.

My boyfriend (at the time) raped me two weeks after I’d given birth to our son. I still had stitches and I was still bleeding (not to mention frequently nursing a newborn), but he didn’t think it was fair that he was being “forced to” wait six weeks until we could resume having sex. One night, when I was conked right out from exhaustion, he carefully pulled my pajama pants down and raped me in my sleep. I immediately woke up because of the pain - it was like having sex with a cactus, given how many healing tears I still had - and tried to push him off, but he just put his hand over my mouth and kept repeating “just let me finish, I’ll be fast”. It was excruciating. There was so much blood.

> 我的男友(在那会)强奸了我,在我刚生完孩子的两周后.我都还有缝线,同时还在流血(更不须提起还要频繁的照顾孩子),但他想在生完孩子,到再次发生性交的时间需要六周是不公平的.一天晚上,当我精疲力尽的时候,他脱下我的内衣,然后在我睡着的时候强奸了我.我因为那种痛立刻就醒了-那就像和仙人掌性交,我流尽了在康复期间的眼泪,然后尝试去推开他,但他用手捂住了我的嘴,然后一直重复"让我结束,我很快的".那很折磨人.那里流了很多的血.(Miss,I'm sorry for what happend to you)

I think what bothers me most about this story is that I stayed for months after that incident, and all the other times that followed (he got away with it once, why not keep doing it?). He was the only income earner in the house and I didn’t have or know how to obtain the resources to escape. Finally, when my son was three months old, I just went for it. I packed my son’s and my own things up in one night and was gone the next day. I feel stupid for staying so long, but at the time I didn’t now what to do. My parents had the attitude of “well, you were the one who got pregnant by him” for a long time, and I didn’t want to prove them right (pride can be so poisonous). My ex also liked to tell me that if I ever took his son away from him he’d find me and kill me. I wasn’t sure whether or not to believe that.

> 这个往事最烦我的是,在这个事故后,我还待在那里一个多月,然后他在其他时间也一样那样子对我(他有一次走开了,为什么不一直做呢?).他是房里面唯一有收入的,然后我不懂如何去获取逃离的资源.最后,在孩子三个月大的时候,我就在毫无资源的情况下走了.一天晚上,我收拾好孩子和我的东西,然后在第二天就离开了.我对待在那里那么久感到愚蠢至极,但那会我还不知道该怎么做.我的父母很长一段时间有那个"哼,你才是他让你怀孕的人"(全都是你的错)的态度,而我不想证明他们是对的(自尊有时是很讨厌的).我的前男友并且喜欢去威胁我,如果我把我们的孩子带走,他会找到我并杀掉我.我不能确定要不要相信这个.

My life is much better now, and I have little to no contact with my son’s father. My son is a fantastic young man who is planning his university education and getting ready to start his life. He’s happy and safe, and I now I (eventually) made the right choice to leave.

> 我现在的生活变好了很多,而我也没和孩子的生父进行联系.我的孩子是一个有趣的年轻人,现在正在计划上大学,然后开始他的生活.他安全而又幸福,而我最后做出了那个正确的选择去离开他(前男友).

## 你能分享一个浪漫/悲伤的故事吗?

"Why do you love me?" Meera asked.

> "你为什么喜欢我?" Meera 问.

Raj, who was reading a book, bookmarked the page which he was reading using his index finger. Then he turned to Meera and surprisingly questioned, "Sorry?"

> Raj,那个正在看书的人,用拇指放在他正在看的那页纸上做标记.然后回头看着 Meera 和回答她那个惊讶的提问,"蛤?"

"I mean, just look at me, I got fat." Meera shared.

> "你看,就看看我这模样,我这么胖." Meera 说到.

Raj heard Meera. And, he didn't even utter a single word, but smiled.

> Raj 听到 Meera 的回答.然后,他甚至没有回复一个词,但笑了.

"Reply na." Meera asked again.

> "回答我." Meera asked again.

"Okay, I will reply, but before that, tell me one thing, why do you love me?" Raj politely asked.

> "好的,我会回复你的,在这之前,告诉我一件事,那你为什么喜欢我?"Raj 礼貌的问道.

"What?" Meera raised a doubt on his question.

> "蛤?" Meera 带着疑问的语气对待他的问题.

"I mean, I am skinny. Why do you love me?" Raj explained further and asked.

> "你看,我是猴干呀.那你为什么喜欢我?" Raj 解释了一下原因.

"I don't find you skinny." Meera answered.

> "但我不觉得你胖呀." Meera 回答.

"Exactly my point." Raj just said those three words and returned to his book.

> "这也是我的答案了." Raj 说出这些话之后,然后重新看回了他的书.

Meera understood the answer in those words and smiled. Behind the book, a face already joined her smile.

> Meera 明白在这个回答里面的含义,然后笑了.在书后面,另一张脸也笑了.

## 对哪些东西,你理解无能?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is something you will never understand?](http://qr.ae/TU8Jnl)

Date: March 01 2018

One time, Boyfriend and I (had pre-booked a window and a middle seat) were travelling to Kerala.

> 一次,我男票和我(订了窗边和中间的座位)正在去 Kerala 的旅途上.

Five minutes inside the plane, the aisle next to me yet to be filled, a charming young lady approached me in perfect but accented English (we both spoke our mother tongue)

> 在机内 5 分钟后,在我旁边的座位满了,然后一个迷人的年轻的女士靠近我,带着完美的英语口音(我和男朋友两个都带着我们自己的口音)

Miss Charming: I have this aisle seat and would like to give you a window seat for your middle, since I am travelling with my husband.

> Miss charming: 我有这个过道座位的票,然后想用一个窗边的座位票来和你交换你中间这个座位,我和丈夫一起出来旅行.

Me (thinking she might have thought I am travelling alone, I point out to boyfriend) Umm… Actually we are together

> 我(她可能以为我是单身旅行的,我指了一下我的男票)Umm...事实上我们是坐在一起的.

Miss Charming: I see. I am travelling with my husband

> Miss charming: 我知道了.我和我的丈夫一起旅行.(Sheldon,is that you?)

Me (confused, not sure if we are understanding each other) Yeah but we are together as well. I can’t swap seat with your husband. I am sorry.

> 我(有点无语,不确保我们双方是否都懂得对方的意思)但我们也想待在一起,我不能和你的丈夫交换位置,不好意思.

Miss Charming: What do you mean you are together.I am with my husband Is he your what? boyfriend?

> Miss charming: 你说什么在一起.我和我的丈夫,他是你的谁? 男朋友?

Me (now I know she is ridiculous, going by her voice but still can’t avoid answering): Yes.

> 我(我现在知道她有点搞笑了,在她的责问里面,但不能拒绝回答她的问题):是的

Miss Charming: So, you won’t allow me to sit with my husband because you have ‘a’ boyfriend with you?
pause
Also, I am giving you a window seat for a middle. I am being fair. You are being stubborn and that too for a ‘boyfriend’ (almost shaming me for having a boyfriend in the first place)

> Miss charming: 所以,因为你有'一个'男朋友,就不允许我坐在我丈夫的旁边了?
> 暂停一下(最怕空气突然安静...)
> 同时,我给你一个窗边的位置来交换你坐在中间的位置.我很公平了.你还在顽固的认为这都是为了你'男朋友'(在第一次的时候,都差点让我觉得有男朋友是一件羞耻的事)

Me: I don’t believe this is happening. (I call the flight attendant)

> 我: 窝草.(我把服务员叫过来)

Flight attendant comes and she starts ranting. I wait for her to finish so that I can tell my preference to keep my seat. The attendant does not bother to hear my part of the story but asks me with a smile ‘Ma’am, is there a problem if you swap your seat with her husband?’

> 乘务员过来,然后她就开始怒吼了.我等着她叫玩,然我我才能告诉乘务员我更愿意是坐在这里.那个乘务员耐心的听了我说的,但 ta 笑着问我 "Ma'am,你和她的丈夫交换座位,有什么不方便的地方吗?"

‘Yes. Actually. I am travelling here with him, my boyfriend and we want to sit together.’

> "是的,肯定不方便.我和他一起旅行,我和男友想坐在一起."

‘But Ma’am, she is on her honeymoon.’

> "但 Ma'am,她正在度蜜月."

‘It would still be a No’

> "但我还是拒绝"

The air hostess left because the flight was full and she could not move both of them next to each other anyway. She called up her husband to take the aisle next to me because she didn’t want to sit next to ‘such a disturbance’.

> 空乘因为飞机满员,而且她怎么也不能把 ta 们两个凑在一起.她叫她的丈夫和她交换坐在我旁边的机票,因为她不想坐在"一个烦人"的旁边.

I bet the husband was sorry for her actions. The journey was less stressful because she exchanged the seat with her husband. Boyfriend and I watched a movie together, during the journey and also a stand-up comedy. It was a great journey otherwise.

> 我打赌她的丈夫对她的行为感到尴尬.这个旅程因为她和她丈夫交换位置后而不那么紧张了.我和男友在一起看着电影,在这个旅程之间,这简直就是临时的肥皂剧.另外,就算这样,那也是个不错的旅程.

When the flight landed, she unnecessarily pushed everyone out (difficult since everybody stands up in India as soon as the flight lands, clogging the entire passage), reached our seat and gave me a look full of hatred. Then she called somebody over the phone and narrated the entire incident, with special mention that mine was ‘just a boyfriend’. I was fuming in rage. Boyfriend forced me to listen to music so that I don’t get to hear what she was saying further.

> 在飞机降落的时候,她不必要的推着每一个人(在印度航空一降落里面,当每个人站起来的时候,堵塞住了整一个通道),走到我们的座位的旁边,给我一个白眼.然后她打电话给某一个人,然后描述着整一件事,对我有一个'仅仅是男友'带着特殊的敌意.我想我该愤怒了.我怒了.男友逼着我听歌,那样子我就不会听到她在后面说什么了.

Just because you decided to involve court in your relationship, our relationship does not become any less valuable. I was not invited in your marriage and thus, have no moral obligation to give you special social status for the same.

> 仅仅因为你决定

Even if I was travelling with my friend (not even boyfriend), I still have the right to retain our seats next to each other.

> 即使我和朋友旅行(不是男朋友),我始终拥有权利去保留我们的位置而待在一起.

I fail to understand how can people be intentionally rude and expect to almost dictate their co-passengers, shame them for nothing and expect people to follow their instructions, as if we all are students in a class and she is the principal of the school. It is the cruel outside world, not your home where you can probably rule everybody. The outside world is no way compelled to favour you every time you travel. I remember a worse incident from a train journey where I was travelling alone. I would keep that for another time.

> 我对人能特意无礼且期望以差不多命令的口吻命令你的隔壁座位的乘客,用一些无关紧要的事情来羞辱 ta 们,同时还指望其他人追随她的言论,就像我们还在学校的小学生一样而她就是学校的规则的事理解无能.在无边可是很残忍的,不是你的家,你也不可能对每个人都可以无礼.外边的世界不是你每次出外都能让你合心合意的.我记得另一起更糟糕的事件,在我单独出外旅行的时候.我会把它留在其他时间再说.

EDIT: This paragraph is dedicated to rude people who choose to leave hurtful comment under mine or anybody’s answer who shares their personal life stories. I do share my personal life experiences. If you are in Quora for Wikipedia-like experience with information based knowledge, go ahead and block me right away before ranting under my answer on how I don’t write about aerospace, oceanography and mathematics. I choose to write on light-hearted topics. Many Indians do so, and so do many famous writers from USA and UK. Stop cursing Indians. Cheers.

> 更新: 这个是为了那些专注于无礼的键盘侠在我或其他人分享个人经历的时候留伤害别人的留言的.我的确分享我个人的生活经历.如果你在 Quora 上为了和维基一样的经历和知识,那就屏蔽我,然后在我的回答下面怒吼,为什么我没写航天学,海洋学,和数学相关的东西.我选择去写这些无聊的话题.许多印度人也这么做,同时许多有名来自美国和英国的写手.停止职责印度人.欢呼.

Edit 2: People who are sad because she was on her honeymoon, think about a situation where a conversation would be

> 更新 2: 有些因为她在度蜜月这件事而感到伤心,想想如果是如下的对话

“Hi, Would you please like to exchange your seat with my husband since we are on our honeymoon and wish to sit next to each other”

> "Hi,请问你可以和我丈夫交换座位没?因为我们现在度蜜月,我想和他坐在一起."

“Umm..wait. I would love to help. Since I am also travelling with my boyfriend and will be bored the entire flight, how about you try if the person beside your husband is willing to exchange. In case he doesn’t want to, we can ask the air hostess for some arrangement with any other seat. Even if that does not work, I will exchange the seat with your husband”.

> "Umm..等一下.我很乐意去帮助你们.我和男友一起旅行,如果分开的话,整一个航程会很无聊的.不如你问问你丈夫旁边的人是否可以交换座位.如果不愿意的话,我们可以找空乘安排一下其他的座位.即使这些都没有用,那我会和你丈夫交换座位的."

That would have been a happy situation for all of us and a much desired civic and socially acceptable one. We are all grown up and should learn how to behave in public. I have given up the seat in my last flight to a 8-year-old girl because she wanted to sit by the window. The entire journey she kept on comparing the shape of the cloud with different animals, alphabets and what not. Such a good company. Her mother told me “My child wants to sit by the window. If you don’t mind, can you let her use the window for some part of the journey?”

> 那样子是对双方都是一个很好的解决方案,而且也更能接收这种解决方案.我们都成年了,我们应该学会自己控制自己在公共地方的行为了.我在最后一次旅行中给一个 8 岁的小屁孩因为她想坐在窗边让了我在窗边的座位.整一个旅程,她都在把那些不同形状的白云和动物,字母来比较哪个像,哪个不像.一个很好的铜牌.她妈妈问我"我的孩子想坐在窗边,如果你不介意的话,你可以让她坐在窗边一段时间没?"

She had the seat all to herself because her mother did not think she is entitled to window seat just because her daughter wants it.

> 她一直坐在窗边的座位上,因为她妈妈不理直气壮的认为她女儿因为想坐在窗边而拥有对那个座位使用的权利.

I went and sat in the auto angrily. She came and sat beside me. My dad brought me the sandwich asking me to please take it along. I was very angry so I denied.

It was during my second year of engineering when I started smoking, At first I used to smoke only 5–7 cigarettes in a day but it started increasing, By third year I used to smoke about a pack in day. I smoked for about 3 years regularly, One night I had this cough and there was blood in it, At first I ignored it but it used to come regularly, My girlfriend once noticed blood strain on my shirt and asked how did I get that, I started to make an excuse but she got me that I was hiding something, She forced me to the nearby hospital to our college, After the reports came I was having lung cancer…It’s only been 2 weeks since I have get to know that I have this disease and my mom doesn't know about it……

This memory is going to haunt me till I die.

> 这个回忆在我死之前,都会伤害我.

In fact, I really did wish that I would just die when this happened to me. With that being said-

> 事实上,我确实希望我在发生这件事的时候,我就挂掉了.这就是说-

I was reading the newspaper (_gasp_). Now, there was a huge ad for McDonalds on the next page. I was about to flip past it because I don’t really eat at McDonalds, but one of the coupons read “Free Small Fries” and as soon as I saw that, I asked my mom if I could go over to McDonalds and get one. I’m a sucker for free things…if you couldn’t tell already.

> 我正在看报纸(叹气.gif).现在,报纸上有一个超大的麦当劳广告在另一页上面.因为我不常吃麦当劳,正要翻过这一页,但我立刻看见了一张"免费小吃"的优惠券在那,然后我问我妈,我可不可以去麦当劳领取这个.如果你现在还看不出,但我对免费的东西毫无抵抗力.

Obviously, I didn’t read the small print (always read the small print, kids).

> 显然,我没有看那个小小的字(一定要看小的字,小屁孩们)

There’s a small McDonalds about a block away from my house, so I walked over there alone. Looking back, I am so thankful I didn’t take my siblings with me or my parents, because I just know that my family would never let me hear the end of it. They would recount this tale over every family dinner, at my wedding, and probably even at my funeral.

> 在离我家一个街区的地方,有一家很少的麦当劳,所以我自己去到那里.现在回忆起来,幸好我没有带上我的老爸老妈和兄弟姐妹们,因为我知道他们会一直拿这件事来取笑我.ta 们会一次又一次在家庭聚餐,我的婚礼,甚至在我的葬礼上面说这个事.

I awkwardly presented the cashier with my coupon. He took it reluctantly, shooting me a disdainful stare. “That’s it?” he said.

> 我笨拙的给那个收款员出示我的优惠券.他一脸嫌弃的拿着我的优惠券,给我了一个鄙视的眼神."就这样?"他说.

I scrounged my pockets for some spare change. “Sorry, I don’t have any money on me right now.”

> 我翻出我的口袋找一些空余的零钱."不好意思,我现在没有一点钱在身上."

He printed out my pitiful receipt and thrust it into my hand. I then joined the line of people waiting.

> 他打印出我那可怜的收据然后扔到我手上.之后,我排在那些等着取餐的队伍里面.

When it got to my turn, the cashier held a bag fries in his hands. “Thank you,” I said, reaching out to take my fries-

> 当到我领取的时候,那个收款员在他手上拿着一袋炸的零吃."谢谢",我说,然后伸手去拿那个袋子.

He snatched the fries back. “No, no, you have to smile.”

> 他把那袋零食缩回去了,"不行,不行,你还必须得笑给我看."

I looked at him with a ‘wait, what did you just say’ kind of look. “No, I don’t have to.”

> 我看着他带着一脸"蛤,你刚才在说什么的"表情,"不,我不需要对你笑的."

“Yes, you do.”

> "是的,你要的"

“No, I don’t.”

> "不,我不需要"

“Ma’am, you have to smile in order to get your fries.”

> "Ma'am,你必须对我笑了,才能拿走你的零食"

“Is that a law now?”

> "现在这个是法律了吗?"

I tend to get very defensive when confronted.

> 我正在努力的自我保护.

He pulled out my coupon. “Free small fries WITH SMILE,” he said, accentuating the ‘with smile’ part.

> 他把优惠券拿出来."微笑换免费小吃",他说,加重那个"微笑"部分的语气.

I felt my face grow hot and I suddenly wished that a hole would open up underneath me and swallow me whole.

> 我感觉我的脸正在发热,然后我突然希望有一个洞能藏起来了.

“Uh, sorry?” I said meekly. I then gave the cheesiest grin in my entire life, snatched the fries out of his hands, and marched out of the restaurant, trying to maintain the littlest bit of dignity I had left.

> "Uh,不好意思,那样?"我温驯的说.然后我干涩的露齿笑在我脸上,从他手上夺过那个袋子,然后走出那个餐店,尝试去保留一点剩余不多的自尊.

Five seconds later, the same cashier marched outside and handed me my ketchup packets. “Don’t worry, ma’am, you don’t need to smile for the ketchup,” he said, smirking.

> 5 秒钟后,同一个收款员走到外边,然后递给我一包番茄酱."不要担心,Ma'am,你不需要笑就可以拿走这包番茄酱."他说,一脸假笑.

I guess he got the last laugh.

> 我想是他笑到了最后.

## 有哪些默认的社交规则?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What are some unwritten social rules everyone should know?](http://qr.ae/TU86Ke)

Date: March 07 2018

When invited out to dinner, and the host is paying, watch for what he or she orders. Order something the same price, or lower. The host’s chosen price is the indicator of what he or she can comfortably pay for everyone else.

> 当你被邀请外出吃饭的时候,然后是请你的那个人付款,看着 ta 点的菜.然后你点一些同样价格或者更低价格的食物.ta 选择这个价格是一个指标,一个 ta 是否可以为别人支付而不会感到不爽的指标.

Updates:

There are many good thoughts and questions in the comments. So you don’t have to read through them all, I’ll add the best suggestions here.

> 更新: 在留言里面有很多很好的问题和建议.为了你不会去查看全部的留言,我给你添加到这里了.

The most important thing is, if you are a guest, know this rule, so you have some guideline to follow if nothing else is said.

> 最重要的是,如果你是一个客人,要知道这条规矩,如果你自己有一些参考标准那就没什么要说的了.

A buffet is a simple solution a host might choose. The price per person is set, and each guest can enjoy what they like. Fun

> 自助餐是一个请你的人会做出的简单选择.每个人的价格都定下来了,而且每一个客人可以享受他们各自喜欢的东西. Fun

This whole method came about in the 1950s or earlier, when it was much more polite not to be explicit about money. These days, if you can, you can say “I’m paying, but if you want something over $25, please chip in.” That way, you can order whatever you want, and everyone can know the guidelines.

> 这个主意来自 1950 年或者更早,当不直接公布价格显得更礼貌的时候.那些日子里面,如果你可以,你说"我付款,但如果你点了超过 25 美元,那就 AA 吧."那样子,你就可以点你喜欢的任何东西,而其他人也知道你的底线在哪里.

Obviously, this old etiquette rule has its downsides. Say everyone knows the rule. The host must order food at the price he can afford for everyone, even if he would prefer something cheaper - like maybe he likes grilled cheese or is a vegetarian or is eating only salad to lose weight.

> 显然,这些旧的礼节也有着不好的一面.假设所有的人都知道这个规则.主人一定会点那些 ta 能提支付得起的食物给每一个人,尽管 ta 喜欢更便宜一点的 - 就像 ta 或者喜欢烤芝士或者是素食主义者,或者是仅仅为了减肥而吃沙拉.

The host or hostess can inform others by saying “I’m having the X dish” before the waiter comes around to take orders. Or the host can arrange to order first, and speak loudly so everyone hears.

> ta 可以在服务员来取订单前,告诉其他人说"我要 x 盘"(特殊的意思?).或者可以先下订单,然后大声告诉其他人.

Of course, if the host does not say what he or she is ordering, you can’t use this rule. See several options in the comments, such as simply ordering something reasonable, or not ordering first and matching price or item for what someone else does.

> 当然,如果那个主人不说 ta 究竟点了什么,你就不能使用这条规则了.看了一些在留言里面的选项,比如点一些合理的东西,或者不首先点餐等别人先点餐,然后参考别人点的价格点餐.

As we do get more up front about money and offers to take people out, there are options like ordering something cheaper, but telling people to go ahead and order what they like, or order up to a certain amount.

> 如果我们有更多的预算可以请别人吃饭的话,这里有些选项可以自己点一些便宜,然后告诉其他人可以点他们自己喜欢的,或者点到一定的数额.

Alcohol complicates the issue. You may want to let people know that they can pay for their own, or set a one-drink limit on your own tab.
Groups that go out regularly often have their own rules. That works very well. See some excellent options in the comments.

> 酒水让这个问题更复杂.你可以让他们知道 ta 们可以自己的(AA),或者告诉只能喝一杯在你的准则上面.团队出去通常有他们自己的规则.那些都很好的兼容各个问题.在留言里面也看见了一些很好的解决的方法.

## 17 岁,我爸妈要把我扔了

From:  [I am 17, and my parents are going to kick me out ...](http://qr.ae/TU83dr)

Date: March 08 2018

Honestly you are not alone. I was 15 turning 16 and my parents sat me down ask me what I wanted for my 16 birthday. Instead of asking for a car like a lot of kids , I said I’d like to go visit my brother in Los Angeles ( I am from Bedford NH). My brother year older than myself. My parents divorced when I was 11, and they remarried. My step mother was happy for me to go visit my brother … they said they’d buy my plane ticket there. But wouldn’t it be fun if I got a job there, saved money and flew back. Convinced me that I could spend more time with my older brother. So I agreed because I knew I had a home to cone back to. I left all my stuff just packed a few things . Once I got to Los Angeles I was given a pillow and a blanket to sleep on the floor. No problem, he says after a month I had to leave , he was going to kick me out. I said I just need time to get a job, save money and go back home. Two weeks I found a job with Wendy’s old fashioned hamburgers . I soon learned they hold two weeks pay back then I get paid after that. Three weeks pass by and my brother said I have one week left and im out. I thought this is a joke - can’t be serious …? I talked to my step mother and father and they said they had a garage sale and all my stuff was sold. Joke right - can’t be serious …?

> 老铁,说实话,你不是一个人.在我 15 岁快满 16 的时候,我爸妈叫我坐下,然后问我要什么作为我 16 岁生日礼物.相比其他小屁孩要一辆车作为生日礼物的情况,我说我想去看一下我在拉山鸡(洛杉矶)的哥哥.我哥哥比我年长一岁.我的父母在我 11 岁的时候就离婚了,然后 ta 们各自组建个自己的家庭.我的继母对我去我哥那很开心... 他们说给我买机票到那边.如果我在那边没工作的话,那就会开心不起来了,要自己买机票飞回来.说服我说那样子我有更多的时间和我的哥哥在一起.所以我同意了,因为我知道我可以回来的.我打包了很少的几件东西,然后把大部分的东西留下来了.在我到拉山鸡之后,我只有一个枕头和睡袋,睡在地板上面.我不介意,他说在一个月后我必须离开,不然把我赶出去.我说我只需要一些时间去找一份工作,存一些钱,然后我就自己飞回去了.两个星期后,我找到一个在汉堡店里的工作.然后我才知道他们那边是两个星期才付一次薪资的.三个星期过后,我哥说我必须在一个星期内搬走.我还以为那只是一个玩笑-不会是真的吧...? 我告诉我的继母和老爸,然后他们说他们把我的东西全都卖掉了.开玩笑吧,怎么可能是真的?

i called my relatives and they said they didn’t want to get involved. They were sorry.

> 我打电话给我的亲戚,然后他们说他们不想接待我,他们很不好意思.

Thats when it started hitting me. Ohmygod! Fourth week my brother dropped me off with luggage in my hand on corner of Hollywood Blvd and highland at a drug store . I still thought this is some sort of joke.. can’t be serious …?

> 然后这些开始打击我了.窝草.第四个星期,我哥把我和我的东西扔在了在好莱坞一家大麻店外边.我还在想这一定是某些笑话吧...不会是真的吧?

after about an hour in heat dripping in swet. I started walking to work … miles away. I walked through prostitutes, drug dealers , city tourists and some really bad looking city streets .. I finally made it to Wendy’s old fashioned hamburgers to start working. I put my luggage in the back store room. I went to work .. still in disbelief… can’t be serious …? I put on a smile and went to work. I prayed something fierce to god to make sense of this. I was literally flipping hamburgers… one girl APRIL asked me whst was going on after I had taken my break. She noticed the luggage . That’s when it hit me—this is serious im homeless. God answered my prayers .. sent me April and her family who decided to take me in. I saved money to get myself an apt. It was bedbugs and awful but it was mine. My parents my relatives my brother just disowned me…? But I had April’s family now. Eventually I moved to another place with someone I met into a house that relationship lasted some years I saved money like crazy … I saved $1000. Emergency fund in the bank. I always had a quick escape out of every situation . I trusted no one. Until I heard your post I didn’t know it could happen to others . I guess it does. Your now in my prayers

> 一个小时后,被热到汗流浃背.我开始走到工作的地方...一公里远.我走过了站街的女孩,卖白粉的,城市的小痞子,和一些十分难看的街道...我最后终于走到了工作的汉堡店.我把我的行李扔在后面的仓库里面.然后去工作...还是不能相信...不会是真的吧? 我给我自己笑了笑,然后开始工作.我祈祷一些猛烈的东西,好让 ta 让这一切变得有意义.我是一个很渣的服务员...一个女孩 APRIL 在这之后问我发生了什么事,在我们休息的时候.她注意到了我的行李.就是这一会,我才确定我无家可归了.God 给我的祈祷回应了...给我派来了 April 和她的家庭,她们决定接纳我一阵.我给自己存钱然后租了一个公寓.那里有臭虫而且很糟糕,但起码是我自己的了.我的家人刚把我抛弃了?但我现在有 April 的家庭了.最后我去到其他地方,在那个公寓里面我停留了数年,我像疯子一样存钱...我存了 1000 美元.在银行里面作为紧急资金.我总是在各种情况里面,最快的逃离.我不相信任何人.知道我看到你的发布,我才知道这些在别人身上也发生了.我想这些都发生了.你现在在我祝愿的那些人里面.

My faith in god has helped me countless times. I feel s connection with god that is always with me. Whatever you do… don’t give up. Before you are 18. Get a plan in place. Focus on you. Save money. Asking questions is good when you don’t know . I didn’t have that but I did manage to make my way. I don’t know what resources are out there for you. Research , set a plan in motion. Attend church. God does not throw you out like yesterday’s trash. God is with you always

> 我相信 God 在很多时候都帮助我.我感到我和 ta 存在着联系,而 ta 一直在我的生变.不论你做什么,不要放弃.在你 18 岁之前,在一个地方准备一个计划,专注于自己.存钱.在你不知道的情况问问题是一件好事.我还没做到这些,但我的确开始往这上面走.我不知道你那边有什么资源.研究,然后开始计划.参加教会.God 没有想昨天的垃圾一样把你扔在外边.ta 一直在你身边.

whatever you do —focus on you. I was in shock until it really hit me what was happening . Find s resource clinic where you can talk to someone about what you’re going through.

> 不论你做什么-要专注你自己.我还在震惊中知道这些全都发生了.找一个资源医疗站,那里你可以和一些人来诉说你究竟经历了什么.

My step mother just wanted my father for herself. My mother was an alcoholic and useless. My brother became both drug addict and alcoholic once he moved to Los Angeles. My relatives useless to me. I was neither a drug addict or alcoholic . I was s good decent kid. I had god.

> 我的继母只想我老爸属于她自己.我妈是一个没卵用的酒鬼.我哥在他去拉山鸡的时候就变成了一个吸白粉的和酒鬼.我的亲戚对我也没卵用.我不是酒鬼也不对药物上瘾.我只是一个小学生而已.我有 god.

I was 17 years old and living in Paris. One early evening I went to the café downstairs to write and spotted a guy looking at me across the bar. He looked wild and bewildered and beautiful and I went over to introduce myself.

> 那一年,我 17 岁,活在巴黎.一个比较早的傍晚,我走到楼下的咖啡馆里面去写一点东西,然后注意到一个男人正在吧台的另一边看着我.他看起来很帅,然后我去到他那边介绍我自己.

After half an hour at the bar we stepped outside, and proceeded to walk across the whole city, talking through the night.

> 在吧台里面谈了一个小时后,我们走到外边,我们走过整一座城市,一整晚都在交谈着.

I told him about Mexico, my surreal, colorful country and why I loved it so, and he told me about South Africa, describing a place I could not believe was real.

> 我告诉他关于墨西哥,我的超现实而又美丽的国家和我为什么喜欢墨西哥的原因,他告诉我关于南非,给我描述了一个我根本不相信是真的地方.

I did not see my friend again for decades but learned through social media he had become a photographer.

> 在余后的十多年里,我们没有再能相见,但我从社交媒体上得知,他成为了一个摄影师.

One day I got a book in the mail. It was a coffee table book depicting Mexico and this guy’s name written across the cover.

He had photographed a colorful, surreal country, he said, inspired by a night he walked across Paris with a curly haired girl who had approached him in a bar.

> 他给多彩,超现实的墨西哥拍照了,他说,创意来自一个在巴黎在酒吧里面自动接近他的女孩子,一起和他走过那座城市的那晚.(就像那部话痨电影:爱在黎明破晓前???)

## 哪件事最让你煎熬?

From:  [What is the most painful thing you’ve endured?](http://qr.ae/TU8fq9)

Date: March 14 2018

Got a phone call from my partner saying my two-year-old son had found a box of sleeping pills in a friend’s bag and eaten them all (57). The hospital was literally across the road so I told her to take him and the empty box directly to the hospital. Across the road remember.

> 接到一个我伴侣的电话,说我 2 岁的孩子把 ta 朋友的一盒安眠药全都吃了(57 片).马路对面有一家医院,所以我告诉她立刻清空那个盒子然后把 ta 带去医院.记得吗,就在马路对面的医院.

Took 45 mins for me to get to the hospital. She had not arrived. Rushed to the apartment to find her watching TV. I grabbed my son and the box and took him to the hospital. ( Pain : realisation his mother didn't give a shit )

> 我花了 45 分钟然后才到医院那里.而她还没到.我急忙跑回公寓,然后发现她正在看电视.我抓起我的儿子和那个盒子就冲过去医院了.(心疼:意识到他妈一点也不在乎他)

Turned out that one of those pills can put an adult out for eight-hours straight. The doctor explained that they dissolve in the mouth rapidly and that is where most of the absorption takes place. But my son was as bright as a button and very curious about the things going on.

> 发现那些安眠药一片可以让一个成年人睡 8 个小时的为例.那个医生解释他们不能解决这些口服药效比较快吸收的东西.但我的儿子还跟灯泡一样灵活,还在很好奇发生了什么事.

He further explained that what works on adults, may not work at all on children. Also that drugs are not tested on children so we have no true idea what might happen.

> 之后他解析到那些安眠药对成年人有效,可能不会对儿童产生药效.同时那些药并不能在儿童身上测试,所以他们也不知道会发生什么事.

So they took some blood samples, hooked him up to a monitor and I was told to wait 24 hours. Brain damage, kidney failure, liver failure, internal haemorrhage…you name it, all passed through my head. And it was all like a truck heading toward this bright, curious kid who had no idea of the monster stalking him. And there I was, unable to do a thing to stop it, impotent. Never in my life had I felt so utterly useless.

> 所以他们取走了一些血样,给他戴上监控仪,然后告知我要等 24 小时.脑部伤害,肾脏衰竭,肝脏死亡,内出血...所有你能想到的,都一一的在我的脑海里面出现.然后这些东西好像一下就全部撞在了一个聪明,好奇的小屁孩身上,他对跟着他的野兽完全没有感觉.然而我在那里,却不能做一件事去阻止这些发生.从来没在我的人生中有过这种无助感.

Not a sentimental person by nature but if you had told me that jumping off the roof would have saved him, I would have asked you to show me the stairs. Seriously, I was shocked at myself at just how easy that option seemed to me if offered.

> 我天生不是一个感性的人,但如果你我告诉我,我跳楼可以救他的话,我只会问你楼梯在哪.认真的,我都对我自己感到震惊,做出这个选择太过于简单.

Kept him awake for as long as I could, it was already late for him. The idea that these could be our last moments together were not going to leave me. He dropped off suddenly as overtired toddlers are inclined to do while I fought the army of monsters that were occupying my mind.

> 我尽可能的让他保持清醒,但对他来说已经很晚了.这是我们最后的时光的想法一直在我思绪里面挥之不去.在我和我内心想法作斗争的时候,他忽然晕过去了.

At one point, a doctor and support-staff burst into the room and all descended on my son. False alarm, his heart-monitor had become detached and what they had seen from the monitor was a dying child. They were on the ball, I give them that.

> 在那会,一个医生和医护人员冲进这间病房,全都围在我儿子的身边.错误的警告,他的心脏检测仪被他弄掉了,那些医护看见的却是一个快要挂掉的小屁孩.他们很及时,我应该给他们一声赞誉.

If my heart didn't slow down, I was going to need help myself.

> 如果我的心脏没有变慢,我需要去帮一下我自己.

His mother did pay a brief visit. Checked him over and walked out. It was cursory, to save face but no real interest. I knew then that we were finished as a couple.

> 他的母亲连看都没来看一下.只来查看一下他然后出就走了.这很草率,去保留自己的面子但不真心实意.我知道这个,所有我们离婚了.

An eternity passed and I got so very old. He slept, laughed a little in his sleep, fidgeted from time to time (which for me, was always a precursor to an emergency).

> 在整一件事我变得很衰老.他睡着了,在睡着的时候甚至笑了一下,每时每刻都很烦躁(当然这是我,我一直都很紧张)

Around 7am, he awoke, eyes wide open and said: ‘Papa, j’ai faim!’ (‘Daddy, I’m hungry’). Can’t say I’ve ever heard anything so beautiful.

> 在早上 7 点左右,他醒了,眼睛挣得很大说:"老爸,我饿了".再也没有比这句更漂亮的话了.

He was finally released, fed and quite buoyed up by his adventure.

> 最后他出院了,吃饭和鼓励他度过这场危机.

Back home, his mother greeted him with enthusiasm but there was an edge that told me that it was all an act. Turns out she had had a lover for a while and was clearly besotted.

> 回家之后,他妈欢迎他但那些有一条边界告诉我,这些全都是必要的演习.发现她有一个野男人有一阵子了,这是很愚蠢的一件事.

Might have forgiven that save allowing herself to despise even her child. Her lover was welcome to her. Seventeen years later and my son is still with me. She never bothered to visit, ever.

> 或许原来她为了自己甚至可以来拿自己的儿子都不顾.她的野男人喜欢她.17 年后,我和我孩子都还在一起.而她从来没有探望过,一次都没.

BTW: Those child-proof pill-boxes. They are not. He got it open in seconds.

> 顺便说一下:那些小屁孩的药盒.他们没用.他在拿到的时候就打开了.(翻译成 shit 一样,窝草)

"My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics. Because one day there may well be proof of multiple universes."

> "我的建议是,对于那些心碎的女孩子,应该更努力去学习物理理论知识.因为某一天可能会证明平衡宇宙是真的存在的."

"It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another different universe. And in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction."

## 人生中最惨的是什么?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What has been the roughest moment in life?](http://qr.ae/TU1pmA)

Date: March 19 2018

When my husband caught me cheating on him. There are no excuses, it was an incredibly stupid, selfish, and insane thing to do to someone who didn’t deserve it. The person I cheated on my husband with wasn’t worth it, that’s for sure.

> 当我丈夫发现我给 ta 带绿帽的时候.这没有借口,完全是一件愚蠢,自私,和没脑的去做了一件事去伤害那些不该伤害的人.我出轨那个男的是不值得的,这是肯定的.

After telling most of my friends and family what I did, my husband packed his bags and left. I spent a week on my couch contemplating suicide and hitting absolute rock bottom. My friends all took his side, understandably. Almost everyone I loved turned away. I fell physically sick with some sort of insane flue—the worst I’ve ever had in my life, probably from the stress.

> 在告诉我大部分的朋友和家庭我的出轨之后,我丈夫收拾了他的行李然后走了.我花了一个星期躺在沙发上,尝试自杀,低沉到谷底.我的朋友全都站在他的那一边,这些都是可以理解的.差不多,我爱的,全都跑了.我在一些虚无里面,我感到实实在在的不舒服,我生活里面从来没出现的,大概都来自压力里面.

I could’ve turned to the guy and tried to start fresh. New life, new boyfriend, new friends… Get that divorce and start over. Instead, I realized that what I had was worth fighting for, even if it took years to get it back. I ended the affair with that guy.

> 我本可以转向那个男的,然后开始新的生活.新的生活,新的男朋友,新的朋友...离婚然后重新开始.代替的是,我意识到我有一些东西值得去争取,尽管那些会花上很多年才能争取到,我和那个男的断了联系.

I wrote to each friend and family member who knew about this that I was going to do whatever it took to build my life back. I wrote to my husband. I begged him to come back. By some miracle… he did. We went to counselling, I went to therapy. I opened my life to my husband: no more privacy. He had access to everything, which I was completely fine with.

> 我写给我的每一个知道我这件事的朋友和家庭成员,我不论付出什么都要去做,去把我的生活重建回来.我写给我的丈夫.我乞求 ta 能回来.神奇的是,他回来了.我们去参加辅导,我去治疗.我把我的生活敞开给我的丈夫:不再具有自己的隐私.他能连接我的任何东西,现在我也能完全接受了.

It took a long time, but eventually my friends came back. My husband’s trust slowly began to rebuild. Years and years later, our marriage is strong-full of incredible love, respect, and trust. I look back at what I did in complete disgust. I live everyday with that heartbreak, wishing I’d never put such an amazing person through that. Although that time was dark, it was the push I needed to wake up and stop living like a selfish idiot.

> 这花了很长的时间,但最后我的朋友都回来了.我的丈夫开始慢慢的重建对我的信任.一年接着一年,我们的婚姻变得更加稳固,尊重和信任.我每次回首都觉得那是最恶心的一件事.这让我活着的每一天都心疼.我希望我曾不做出这件事,对那么爱我的人.尽管那段时间很黑暗,但也推着我自己去醒悟,然后停止成为一个自私的杀掉.

I wouldn’t trade the life I have now for the world. It took incredible pain and humiliation to get here, but it’s what led to my amazing life now. For those going through a dark time, take it day by day… one step at a time. I never thought I’d ever get here, but with hard work and patience, it will get better.

> 我现在肯定不会用我的生活和这个世界做交易.我承受不可磨灭的痛苦和羞辱才走到了现在,但我现在也过得挺好.经历过那些黑暗的阶段后,一天接着一天,一次一小步的走着.我从来没想过我可以走到现在这里,但努力去做,然后耐心等待,这些都会变好的.

Years ago, I used to enjoy playing Xbox in my free time.

Often, my girlfriend would come and sit next to me and watch me play, cheering me on, going “AHHH” when I died or getting excited when I beat a level.

> 通常,我的女票也会来,然后坐在我身旁,看着我玩游戏,让我开心起来,在我挂掉的时候难过,在我过关的时候兴奋.

I know that video games, playing or watching, was the last thing on this earth she would want to be doing.

But I knew she enjoyed it because she wanted to be near me and because, I know, she loved me.

She was just leaving the doctors office for a routine checkup, “The doctor told me they had found a lump on my ovaries and that they needed to do more testing.” She reassured me that everything was fine and not to worry.

> 她进行身体检查,刚离开医生的办公室,"那医生告诉我,他们在我的卵巢里面发现了肿块,他们需要做更多的测试."她安慰我所有的东西都还好,不需要担心.

After the call ended, it felt like I’d been crushed under 2 tons of bricks.

> 在这个电话后,我感觉我就像撞上了一堵墙.

In the face of mortal danger, I realized how much of a fool I had been and that we were arguing about stupid, trivial matters in the grand scheme of life.

> 在面对生老病死的时候,我意思我是多么的蠢,为了那些在生活中万万千千无关紧要的事情而和她争执.

But above all, I realized that I’d forgotten how much I loved her.

## 你曾经见过最善良的事是什么?

Date: March 22 2018

I work at a McDonald's and every day a kid walks in to the store With a homeless man. He hands me a 10 dollar bill and gets himself a hashbrown and let's the man get what ever he wants. They both sit down and talk for 15 minutes a day. Eventually the boy and man started looking for jobs so that the man can get a job. Last week the man had an interview and ended up being a salesman. The kid came in and asked for a hashbrown sat down quietly and left. The following day he came in with a big smile on his face. I asked him why he was so happy. He said today he made a new friend, and brought a different homeless man in. Now every weekend the salesman, the boy and his new friend come to McDonald's. The difference this time, the salesman pays for all of them. It brought me to tears and I ended up learning from this boy. I have decided to donate $100 every year to my neighborhood homeless shelter(I make too little to give more). I wish to learn more and educate my self but selfnessless is something I learned in the past few months and will always be a part of me.

> 我在金拱门里面工作,每天一个小屁孩带着一个流浪汉走进这里.他(小屁孩)给我 10 美元现金(我只能说,发达国家)然后给他自己买了一个洋芋块,然后让按个流浪汉点 ta 自己想要的.然后他们会坐在一起,聊 15 分钟左右.最后那个小屁孩和那个流浪汉开始寻找工作,那样子那个流浪汉就可以获得一份工作了.上个星期,那个流浪汉有一个面试,然后得到了一份销售员的工作.那个小屁孩走进来,点了一个洋芋块,然后静静的坐在那里,就离开了.第二天,他脸上带着大大的笑容走进来,我问他为什么这么开心.他说他今天交了一个新朋友,然后的带着另一个流浪汉进来了.然后每一周,那个销售员,小屁孩和他们的新朋友都会来这家金拱门.不同的是,现在那个销售员付他们的餐费了.这让我有点泪目,然后我从这个小屁孩身上学到要刁难东西.我决定给我附近的流浪汉收容所每年捐款 100 美元(我赠予得太少了).我希望去学更多的东西,来教育自己,但慷慨是我过去几个月学到的,然后这个会一直影响我.

The smarter you are, the harder it is for you to date.

> 你越聪明,你约会就会越难.

For both men and women, intelligence is inversely related to dating. Smart people tend to be less social, more solitary, and just overall not as likely to date as less intelligent people. The smarter you are, the fewer people you date.

> 对于男女双方,聪明程度和约会成反比.聪明的人不太喜欢社交,更多的肚子,然后几乎全部都是不喜欢去约见笨的人.你越聪明,你就约会越少.

Wow. I must be a fucking genius.

## 最酷的迟到借口

From:  [What is the coolest excuse for being late to class?](http://qr.ae/TU1CTe)

Date: March 29 2018

She was washing her hair, apparently.

> 显然易见的,她正在洗头.

Adriana is a sophomore in my school and she has beautiful waist-long strawberry blonde hair. She had recently come back from a service learning/volunteer trip in Africa and was late to school on the first day back.

> Adriana 是一个我们学校的大二学生,她有一头很长且发色漂亮的头发.她最近刚从非洲的公共服务/自愿服务的地方回来,然后她回来的第一天就迟到了.

Adriana is a great kid. She is not the kind who was often late to class. She never gave lame excuses like “I had a doctor’s appointment” or “my alarm didn't go off”. She also did not have issues with traffic like the other kids did.

> Adriana 是一个好孩子.她不是那种经常迟到的人.她从来不会给出那种掉渣的借口,像"我要去看医生" 或者 "我的闹钟没有响". 她也没有像其他小屁孩那样子的交通问题.

I wanted to be understanding when she requested a late pass; after all she just spent a week away for a good cause. Adriana was helping paint a school for underprivileged children. I saw pictures of her playing and reading to the kids.

> 在她迟到要进教室的时候,我想知道她为什么迟到.毕竟她只是为了一个好的原因在那边花了一个星期.Adriana 在学校里面帮助那些贫困学生画画.我看见那些她和小屁孩一起读书和玩的照片.

However, I needed to know why she was tardy, so I could record it on her log. “Adriana, why are you late?” Any excuse would have cut it. I expected something along the lines of my flight was delayed or I was jet lagged. But instead she said:

> 不论怎样,我需要知道她为什么迟到了.那样子我就可以在她的记录上面写"Adriana,为什么迟到了?"任何一个借口都可以说得过去.我还以为会得到一些像航班延迟或者路上花费太多时间.

“Oh Ms. Ajaj, I’m so sorry. I had to thoroughly wash and clean my hair before checking in school today.”

> "oh Ms Ajaj,不好意思,我必须今天先洗清理干净我的头发,才能来学校."

“Seriously? You had to wash your hair?” I said sarcastically.

> "你是认真的?你必须清理干净你的头发?"我有点讽刺的说.

“Yes, my mom found lice in my hair after my trip to Africa. She did not want to send me to school before making sure I was clean so that I won’t give lice to my friends.”

> "是的,我妈在我从非洲回来的时候,在我头发上面发现蚤子.她不想我在我清理干净就去学校.在确保我清理干净了,而不会传染给我的同学才让我过来学校."

This was the coolest reason to get lice AND be late for school for sure.

> 这就是最 cool 的理由了,得蚤子,然后迟到.

## 你爸妈做过最牛逼的是什么?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the most badass thing your parent has ever done?](http://qr.ae/TU1FOu)

Date: March 30 2018

This happened during college. I was down with viral fever and had to take a break for three days. My best friend, a girl, was in constant touch via phone and she sounded dull. When asked what the problem was, she said it was nothing and I thought she worried about my health. Day 4, I return to college and I learn that a guy from a different department was teasing her (in an abusive way) and was stalking her everyday. And she, being a very reserved and not so brave, did not even tell it outside. I went and punched the mofo right on his face and broke a couple of teeth. His friends came for his help and started attacking me and my friends came in from nowhere.

> 这发生在我的大学期间.在我病毒性感冒发烧的时候,我不得不请假 3 天休息.我最好的朋友,一个女孩子,在电话联系的时候,她听起来有些迟钝.当我问她是不是发生了什么事的时候,她说没什么,我还以为她是担心我的病情.第四天,我回到学校,然后我知道一个在其他部门的猥琐男一直戏弄她(在毫无节制的情况下),而且每一天追着她.而她呢,一直都很冷淡而且没什么勇气,也没有和别人说.我去那个猥琐男揍了一顿,打掉了他的几颗牙齿.他的朋友来帮他来打我,然后我的朋友也冒出来帮我了.

Once this gang war was done, I and that guy were taken along with our friends to the principal’s office and he started hurling scoldings one after the other. I was a bright student and was always in the good books of every professor and thus it came as a shock to everyone.

> 这个群殴一旦结束,我和那些人一起被带到了校长的办公室,然后校长开始一个一个的骂.我一直以来都是小红花,在所有教授里面都是好学生的模样,然后这场打斗,让他们都震惊 了.

They called all of our parents and my dad came. Even my friend was taken into account here and her mom was called to the college (She didn’t have a dad). Everybody - My head of the department, my principal started scolding me and gave my dad a transfer certificate to fill up for me to take me out from the current college and put me somewhere else. They also told me I had spoilt my career now due to this and for also having a relationship (typical Indian brains ya know, roam around with a girl and she is your girlfriend). My dad remained calm and filled up the form and asked if there are any more procedures to be done. The principal and HOD were stunned (they were apparently just trying to scare us) and asked him if he wasn’t worried about my future. I still remember what he said “If I was him, I would have done the same, what he did was right. No one should stand by when a woman is being harassed. I want my son to be on the front lines to stand up for any sort of injustice. I know the girl for the past 14 years and she and my son have been friends since then”.

> 他们叫我们的父母来学校,然后我爸来了.尽管我的朋友也被带到了这里,然后她的老妈也被叫到学校里面(她没有爸爸).每一个人,我们部门的头头,我的校长开始责骂我,然后给我爸一个证书,让我填写,然后让我转校.他们还告诉我,在这件事之后,我 tmd 一生就毁了,同时拥有异性的关系(典型的印度想法,你知道,和一个女孩子玩,她就是你的女朋友了).我爸很平静的把那张单子给签了,然后问还有其他的手续没.那个校长和部门头头都呆住了(他们很明显就是想恐吓我一下)然后问我父亲,你不担心你孩子的未来吗.我始终记得我爸说的:"如果我是他,我也会这样子做的,他做的是对的.每一个人在女孩子被欺负的时候,都不应该站在一边.我希望我的孩子可以为这样的事情出头.我认识这个女孩子 14 年了,她和我的儿子一直都是好朋友."

Everyone got a month’s suspension and the opposite team got two months suspension, except for that guy who harassed her, he voluntarily got a transfer to some other college. I came out of college as a guy with triple placement and being the highest paid recruit of that year.

> 每一个人的下巴都掉出来了,然后站在站在对面的那些的下巴也掉下来了.除了那个欺负她的猥琐男,他自愿的调到其他的学校了.我像一个带着军衔的男人一样走出学校,那一年,我得到了奖学金(大雾).

When driving back home in the car, dad leans in and asks “You love her or what?”

> 在我们坐车回家的路上,老爸问我:"你是喜欢她,还是?"

Me : _Facepalm_ Typical Indian parents.

> 我:(窝草状)典型的印度父母.

P.S : But dad was the best and he was right, This happened 4 years back and am now engaged to that friend of mine ;)

> Ps: 但老爸是对的,这发生在 4 年前,然后现在我和那个女孩订婚了.

I haven't had a friend since I was 15.

I am now 21.

I have never dated anybody. Never sent a nude or kissed someone.

> 我从没去和被人约会.也没给别人发过裸照或者吻过谁.

Nobody ever texts me. I don't really have any social media because there's no point; I wouldn't have any followers or likes because nobody knows me.

> 没有人曾经给我发消息(10086 都没?).我没真正有一个社交媒体,因为这对我毫无意义.我从来没得到过花束或者别人的喜爱,因为他们根本不认识我.

I go to college and I see people making friends or talking with one another, and it kills me. They aren't quivering with anxiety, how come I do?

> 我去了大学,然后我看见那些交朋友或者和别人交谈,这让我觉得很不舒服.他们看起来一点也不焦虑,但我怎么做得到?

Nobody else really tries to befriend me, and if they do, I feel like I muck it up.

> 没有其他人尝试和我成为朋友,如果他们做了,我想我会不小心把这个弄崩的.

I seldom go out on weekends, if I do it's with my brother, the only person I hang out with.

> 我很少周末出去,如果我出去都是和我兄弟那些一起出去,我唯一能和我玩的人.

I'm extremely bad at conversations because I rarely have them. And then when I'm awkward I beat myself up about it and I feel even worse I don't want to try again. I just want to be invisible.

> 我很不擅长交谈,因为我几乎很少和人交谈.然后当我尴尬的挫败我自己的时候,我感到很糟糕,甚至根本都不想再次去尝试.我只想把自己隐藏起来.

My prime years are whizzing by while I'm at a standstill. Nothing is ever improving and at this rate I will be alone for the rest of my life. If I don't go insane and kill myself first.

> 我的青春在我停顿的时候呼啸而过.没有一件事得到改善,在这种情况下,我会在余生都是单身狗.如果,我没疯掉,或者没把自己干掉的话.

People are important to have around. A life without relationships is not a life at all.

> 环绕在你周围的人,是很重要的.如果生活没和别人产生联系,那生活就不是生活了.
