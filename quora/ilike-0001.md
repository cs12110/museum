## 怎么应对熊家长和熊孩子

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[How do I deal with ....?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-a-situation-where-someone-elses-child-is-misbehaving-in-my-house-and-the-parent-says-nothing/answer/Saddaf-D?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 26 2017

How do I deal with a situation where someone else's child is misbehaving in my house and the parent says nothing?

> 我该怎么应对其他人的小屁孩在我家里行为不礼貌而 ta 们的父母却视而不见?

A friend of mine had a very funny solution to this.

> 我的一个朋友对于这个问题有一个有趣的解决方法.

A couple and their wildling kid used to come over for dinner and every time the kid would be running around in the house and breaking stuff. He also had the nasty habit of throwing things to the floor and breaking them if he didn’t get what he wanted. The parents, especially the mother, were completely blind to the chaos he would cause and would not say a single word to him. He was their little gem.

> 一对夫妻和他们的熊孩子时常会过来吃晚饭,每一次 ta 们的孩子总会跑来跑去而且还会打破屋子里面的东西.ta 还有一个坏习惯如果 ta 得不到 ta 想要的东西就会把东西摔碎在地板上.ta 的父母,特别是 ta 的母亲,选择对 ta 孩子的吵闹视而不见,而且不会对 ta 说任何指责的东西.因为 ta 是他们的最小的那个孩子.

So one day when my friend was expecting this family, he put price tags to everything in the house that could break.

> 那么,一天,当我朋友等这屋子人来吃饭的时候,ta 把屋子里面每一件能打破的东西都贴上了价格标签.

As usual the boy started jumping on things and running around as soon as they arrived, and soon enough, he lifted a vase and threatened to throw it on the floor.

> 和往常一个卵样,那熊孩子开始跳来跳去,一会,ta 拿起一个花瓶然后威胁要把花瓶摔倒地板上.

The parents were there, not saying a word. So my friend took the vase from him, and showed him the tag.

> ta 的父母就在那里,一句话也没出.所以我的朋友从那个小屁孩的手里拿过花瓶,把那个价格给 ta 看.

See this? It’s a price tag. Your daddy will be paying for this if you break it.

> 看见没?这是有标价的.如果你打烂了,你爸就要赔偿.

Then he handed the vase back to the kid and said:

> 然后把花瓶交给小屁孩,说:

Go ahead and break it.

> 继续,打烂它呀 :")

At this point the mother interfered, told the kid to put the vase back and kept the boy on a very short leash for the rest of the evening.

> 这会 ta 妈出来制止了,叫小屁孩把花瓶放回去同时在之后的每一个晚上对那个小屁孩紧紧的约束好.

## 阅读的意义在哪里?

From:  [What's the purpose of reading?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-purpose-of-reading-2/answer/Jack-Dahlgren?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 26 2017

What's the purpose of reading?

> 阅读的目的是什么?

When I was a child I ate a lot of food. Most of it is long gone and forgotten, but certainly some of it became my very bones and flesh.

> 在我小的时候,我吃了很多的食物.大部分的东西早就消失而且被遗忘了,但肯定的是一些成为了我的骨肋和肌肉.

Think of reading as the same thing for the mind.

> 我想阅读和内心的关系也和上面的一样吧.

## 你哭的最惨的一次是什么时候?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[When was the hardest you have cried?](https://www.quora.com/When-was-the-hardest-you-have-cried/answer/Amanda-Rudow?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 27 2017

It was three years ago, the day after my 22nd birthday. I'd just come home from work, and I was exhausted. Numb.

> 这发生三年前,在我 22 岁生日后的一天.刚从公司回到家,我感到精疲力尽而又麻木.

I opened the door to my room expecting to see the usual sight: bags of trash piled up in the corner, and more littered throughout the room. Empty take-out containers, stuff like that. A lot of dirty laundry. A bed with sheets unchanged for… God knows how long.

> 我打开房门期待看到像往常一样的景象:垃圾袋堆积在角落,小垃圾散落在房间各处.空荡荡的行李袋,大概都是这些东西.一大堆肮脏需要换洗的衣物,一床不知多久没换过的床单.

I didn't care- in fact, as I was in the middle of such a bad depressive spell, I didn't really even think about it. All I wanted to do was sleep. My phone was blinking from dozens of unread texts and missed phone calls, but that was normal. I was too mentally drained to even bother reading them.

> 事实上,我不在乎(看得出:")),在陷入很大压力的时,我想都不会想到这些玩意.我所有想做的就是睡觉.手机闪烁着一堆的未读信息和未接电话的提示,但这也很平常.我都懒得花心思去看一下.

So, imagine my shock when I opened the door to a room so clean that the floorboards gleamed.

> 所以,想象一下当我打开门走进一间干净,光亮整洁的房间的震惊.

No more trash. My laundry was clean, and folded in neat piles on top of a pristinely made bed. Even my piano was dusted and shined. The air in the room smelt lightly of perfume, which I recognised as my mother's, as opposed to stale cigarette smoke and old fryer grease.

> 没有垃圾.衣物被清洗了,而且折叠整齐的堆放在床上.即使是满是灰尘的钢琴也焕然一新.房内弥漫着谈谈的芳香,那味道就像我老妈的香水,而不是往常的油烟味道.

Stunned, I checked the rest of the apartment. My roommate's room was the same as always, but the kitchen, toilet, and bathroom were all so clean I almost didn't recognise my own apartment.

> 目瞪狗呆,我查看了房间的其他位置.室友的房间还是和往常一样(乱?),但厨房,厕所和浴室都整洁到差点认不出来这是我住的地方.

I opened my phone and finally checked my messages. My mother had texted me:

> 我打开手机去查看信息.老妈发了一条信息过来:

Call me when you get home tonight. I love you.

> 今晚到家的时候,打电话给我.爱你 :")

I called. My mom put me on speaker-phone. She, my dad, and two younger sisters were bursting with glee as they screamed, “Happy Birthday!!”

> 我打了电话,我妈打开了 ta 手机的扩音器.她,老爸,和两个妹妹突然喊道:生日快乐

They explained that my dad had come over a week before, while I was at work, to drop something off. He told me that he'd cried when he'd seen the state of my room, and had immediately called an emergency family meeting.

> ta 们解析老爸一个星期前,在我上班的时候来过来寄放一些东西.ta 告诉我 ta 看见我房间的状况都哭了(大概因为觉得没照顾好孩子的内疚?),所以 ta 召开了一次紧急家庭会议.

“We know how you get when you're depressed, babe,” said one of my sisters, “so we spent the day cleaning everything. We decided this would be a joint birthday present from us. We love you.”

> "我们知道你在压抑的时候生活会过得怎样,baby"我的一个妹妹说,"所以我们花了一天时间去整理所有的东西给你.我们觉得这是一个对大家都贴合的生日礼物.我们还是那么爱你呀."

I managed to keep it together until I hung up the phone. Then I sat on my shining bedroom floor, put my face in my hands, and cried like a baby.

> 我刻意控制自己的情绪直到挂掉电话.然后坐在地板上,脸埋进手掌里面,哭得像一个小屁孩一样.

I was representing the USA in an international table tennis (ping pong) tournament in Osaka, Japan. The night before, I wandered over to the tournament site to check it out. When there, I noticed a guy wearing a Chinese team jacket. They were and still are the best in the world. Being somewhat cocky, I went over and asked him if he would like to hit some. He did and we eventually played a best-of-three match. I was playing well and managed to eke out a win.

> 我当时代表美国在日本的大阪参加国际兵乓球比赛.在比赛前夕,我漫步到比赛场地去查看一下.当我到那的时候,我留意到一个装着中国队外套的男人.ta 们依然是世界上最好的兵乓球运动员.出于一些自大,我走过去问 ta 是否可以和我打一下兵乓球.ta 答应了,而且我还真的打了一次最好的比赛,我打得很好同时赢了比赛.

Back with my teammates I modestly mentioned that I had beaten a Chinese player. To my astonishment some skepticism was expressed. Being fed up, the next day I suggested to the most skeptical teammate that we stroll over to where the Chinese team was camped out. I didn't see the player from last night, so I started talking to one of the other Chinese players. Finally I casually mentioned that I had won a match with one of his teammates. "Which one?" he asked.

> 回到队友那里,我向他们炫耀我击败了一个中国选手.令人惊讶的是,队友竟然不相信我.休息过后,第二天我建议那个最怀疑我的队友和我一起去中国队那边逛逛.在那边,我并没看到昨晚和我打球的中国运动员.所以,我去搭讪另一个中国运动员.最后我似乎无意中提到我击败了 ta 们之间的一名队友."哪个?"ta 问.

"Well I... Oh there he is, walking over now."

> "嗯,我..., 那个,就是 ta,正在走过来的那个."

"Ah yes", he said, "That's Mr. Chen. He's our cook."

> "哦,哈",ta 说,"这是陈师傅,我们的厨师."

The Five Questions Game.

> 5 个问题的游戏

When I was a broke student in London, I used to go up to strangers in the pub and bet a beer on this one - and I never paid for a drink once. It plays both on a person’s niceness and their ego, so one way or another, you know they’re going down!

> 当我还是伦敦的一个穷逼学生,通常在酒吧和陌生人用这个游戏赌啤酒.而我还没输给任何人.这关于玩弄人的缜密和自负,不是一个就是另一个会出现破绽,那么你就知道 ta 们进入你的圈套了.

Not 4, nor 6. If you reach 7, you have gone 2 too far.

> 不是 4 个问题,也不是 6 个.如果你问到 7 个,那么你走得太远了(渣)

The premise is simple. Let’s say I met this guy John. I offer to play the five questions game: I’ll ask five simple questions, and he has to lie to all five. If he manages to lie to all of them, he wins a beer. If he gets one right, I win a beer.

> 游戏前提很简单.比如我遇到了一个人 John,我和 ta 玩这个'5 个问题'的游戏:我会给出五个简单的问题,如果 ta 说的全是谎话,那 ta 就可以赢得一杯啤酒.如果 ta 在一个回答没撒谎,ta 就要给我买一杯啤酒.

Me: So what’s your name?

> 我: 嗯,那么你的名字叫什么?

John: Bruno.

> John: Bruno(撒谎)

Me: Ha! I can tell you’re a Bruno Mars fan. Interesting. How tall are you?

> 我: 哈.我敢说你是 Bruno Mars 的粉丝.有意思,你身高多少?

John: 12 feet.

> John: 12 英寸

Me: (Looking up) Yeah, that’s definitely a lie Bruno. Ok, what beautiful country are you from?

> 我:(打量 ta 一番)是,这肯定是个谎言.好,你来自哪个漂亮的国家?

John: Germany.

> John: 德国

Me: Haha, Bruno, I said a beautiful country, but sure… (hesitates)… wait, how many questions was that?

> 我: 哈哈,Bruno,我说美丽的国家,但德国就...(犹豫一下),等一下,现在是第几个问题了?

John: Three.

> John: 第三个

Me: Go get me a beer.

> 我: 给爸爸来一杯啤酒 :")

Now this assumes John is a nice guy, who loses because he helpfully provides an answer to me. Sometimes though, John is a douche.

> 假设 John 是一个好人,ta 为我提供了一个答案而输掉了比赛.但有时,John 有时也是个很机灵的人呢.

Me: Haha, Bruno, I said a beautiful country, but sure… (hesitates)… wait, how many questions was that?

> 我: 哈哈,Bruno,我说美丽的国家,但德国就...(犹豫一下),等一下,现在是第几个问题了?

John: Seven (grins wickedly).

> John: 第七个(微笑脸)

Me: Nooooooo! Ah fuck. Damn, you got me. Ah. You’re good. Damn. I mean… come on, did you ever play this game before?

> 我: 哎呀,窝草,好牛掰,你赢了,你牛掰,是我输了,日.你之前是不是玩过这个游戏?

John: (still incredibly proud) No man, never.

> John: (还在自我膨胀)没呀,从来都没.

Me: Go get me a beer.

> 我: 快给爸爸买啤酒.

Works EVERY time.

> 每一次都是我赢.

Going anonymous for my own safety and probably the first question I felt like answering, after my friend suggested to have a look at quora.

> 匿名是为了保护我的安全,同时这也是我朋友建议我来 Quora 上面第一个想回答的问题

So, I am a 32 year old man, who has seen the harsh truth of life at an early age. Back in my early 20’s, I was an average person who was highly motivated and dedicated. After my graduation, I started working on my startup project, at first I was alone but later a close friend of mine became my partner. We worked very hard on our project for a year, with no source of income. Still cutting our expenses through pocket money and savings. After our project was completely ready we started to look for investors as well as customers. But for 6 months we had no one showing interest in our business. All things planned were going down the hill.

> 说来,我很早年纪就看到生活艰辛的一个 32 的老人了.回到 20 岁的时候,我是一个非常有进取心和献身精神的人.毕业后,我开始致力于开发自己的起步项目,刚开始只有自己一个人,但不久后一个好友开始成为我的伙伴.在没有收入的情况下,我们很努力的为项目付出了一年.只能通过削减开支和零用钱来减少开支.在项目完备之后,我们开始寻找可以作为客户的投资人.但 6 个月过去了,没有一个人对我们的项目感兴趣.所有的计划开始变得挫败.

I committed to my long term girlfriend, that we would get married 2 years after graduation, as her parents wanted to get their daughter married too soon. She was pressuring me to get married asap, or else her parents will fix her arranged marriage. But, I was living the lowest life. I had no money to spare, no place to live, I used to sleep in my friends flat. I was completely broke. I requested her to give me time of 6 months and I will figure out something. I had lost my hopes with the startup. I told my partner to pause the business. And I started to look for a decent job. But was not getting any leads from there too, as it was time of extreme recession. I was completely destroyed physically, mentally and emotionally. I was not getting any way out. I slept many nights with empty stomach. Sometimes, I used to sleep on bus stands, when my friend used to work on night shifts.

> 我忠诚于在我们本来毕业后两年就可以结婚的女友,就像 ta 父母要赶紧把 ta 嫁出去的一样.ta 向我施压要尽快结婚,如果晚一点 ta 父母会为 ta 安排婚姻.但我还在活在人生的低谷里面.没钱去消费,没地方住,我通常睡在朋友的地板上.我是一个 100%的穷逼.我请求 ta 给 6 个月时间去想办法解决这些问题.我对起步项目失去了希望.我告诉我的伙伴去停掉这个项目.而我开始找正常的工作,即使在那里,在经济衰退的情况也没有变好.我完全被摧毁了,在身体上,精神上.我没找到任何的解决方法.我很多晚都是空着肚子睡的.有时候,在我朋友需要晚上加班的时候,我甚至睡在公交站台.

Suddenly, one day, I get a call from my girlfriend, and she was crying furiously. She said, her marriage was fixed. And she wanted to run away with me. I was stunned at this point, no words to say, emotionless. I was already broken and this news shattered me into pieces. I remember, I sat in a garden that day, and cried like a baby. Because, she was my first love and I always dreamt my life with her. But, I had to take a harsh decision. I wanted her to marry that guy, because I was a living piece of failure. And at that point in life I knew, I couldn't do anything in life. I called her up and after gathering some guts I told her to marry that guy and forget me. She was broken too, but I had to let her go for her own good. I stopped talking to her completely. And one day I got her marraige invitation card from a mutual friend. I went to her marraige, I was standing at the extreme corner so that no one could see me. I wanted to see her for the last time. I saw her getting married and went home, at my parents house. I was sobbing all the way in the bus journey.

> 猝不及防,一天,我接到我女朋友的电话,而 ta 正在愤怒的哭泣着.ta 说,ta 的婚姻定下来了.而 ta 想和我离开这里.那会,我呆住了,无言以对,麻木,我已经被现实折腾碎了,现在又被切成片.我记得,那天坐在公园里面,像一个小屁孩一样哭着.因为 ta 是我的初恋而且我希望能和 ta 共度余生.ta 也心都碎了,但我为了 ta 拥有更好的生活,必须放手.我开始和 ta 断绝联系.一天,从我们一个共同朋友那里拿到了 ta 的请帖.我出现在 ta 的婚礼里,待在一个没人能看见的角落,我希望见 ta 最后一面.我看见 ta 走进婚礼,就转身回家,回我父母的家.在公交车上,一直哭个不停.

I reached home, directly went on bed and kept crying. I had lost everything at that point in my life. I was almost suicidal. I was extremely low. I rarely had a chat with my parents. I never came out of my bedroom. I just slept all day and watched movies. One day, after lunch, my dad came into my room with a big cardboard box, it had my name written on it. He sat on my bed, besides me. And opened the box and spread all the things around. I was in wonder, what is he doing? Why is he doing that? Then he said, “son, you see this things, these toys, these miniature models,etc etc. these all are the things you always dreamt of having as a child, but I was making only enough money to feed you, I couldn't afford these for you. I used to work extra hours as a assistant even after 8 hours in office, just because I could give you the things that you wanted. I could have easily given up, and not give you these things, but I wanted to see you happy”. My dad with a heavy voice and teary eyes said, “son, what can I do for you, to bring that smile back on your face?”. I wept like a baby that time on my dad's shoulder. I couldn't just stop crying. He made me stop crying, and said, “son, it doesn't matter how many times or how bad you fail, it matters how many times you rise and fight back. Go out and fight back again, be a man, be a warrior, become hard like a rock, so that nothing can shatter you again”.

> 回到家,直接躺在床上继续哭.那会,我失去了我人生中所有的东西.差点就自杀了.情绪很低落.我几乎不和我的父母沟通,也没离开过房间.仅仅是依靠睡觉和看电影来打发时间.一天,在午饭后,我爸带着一个大纸盒走进我的房间,上面写着我的名字.他坐在床上,靠在我身边.打开那个盒子而且把里面的东西撒到到处都是.他在做什么?他为什么要这么做?一会,他说,"儿砸,你看见这些东西没,这些玩具,这些迷你模具,等等.这些是你小时候最想要的东西了,那时我没能力买给你,即使我在办公室工作 8 小时后还要去做兼职,但我还是没能给你想要的.我没轻易放弃,不是给你这些东西,但我真的希望看见你的笑脸".我爸用沉重的语气说,眼里带着泪光."儿砸,我可以为你做点什么,才能让你重新笑起来?".我靠着父亲的肩膀上像一个孩子一样哭着,泪流不止.父亲让我情绪安稳下来,说,"儿砸,无论你失败过少次都没所谓,最重要的是你反击和奋斗了多少次.出去再闯一次,像个男人一样,像个勇士一样,要像石头一样坚硬,那么久再也没有东西可以让你心碎了".

So, I went back to the world again, ready for a tough fight, alert to dodge anything and everything. I became a rock. I called up my partner and convinced him to restart our project. We worked hard non-stop, day and night, restless. Made a well designed business plan. Pitched to hundreds of investors and customers. I was like a fireball, who was just moving ahead destroying all the obstacles. And one fine day, early morning, my partner called me and in an extremely excited voice, he said, “we made it brother, we made it. The USA’s company we pitched is interested in our project, and the first order is for fucking $26M”. At that moment, I was having coffee in a café and my eyes got teary of happiness. I took a cab, and ran into my office. I was filled with joy and a new energy, on my way to office I was thinking of gifting something to the man who deserved this success the most, I decided to gift him his dream car, “the Mercedes s-class” as money was not an issue, finally. I called up a friend who was working in Mercedes-Benz and asked him, if there was any S-Class available for immidiate delivery. He was shocked at first, but I promised to tell him the whole story later and look for a S-Class first. I reached office, and as I entered the office, my best friend came running towards me crying, and hugged me. I was surprised to see her in my office firstly, then she said, “your dad had a severe heart attack, he is serious”. I broke into pieces that moment, I fell on ground, totally blanked. For a while, I thought they are playing a prank, but they were true. I didn't know, what to do, my brain stopped working. My best friend and my partner somehow put me in the car and we were off to my family's place. We were about to leave the city, just then the guy from Mercedes called up and said that my S-Class was ready. I insisted my friends to let me take that car and make dad happy again one last time. We went to the showroom, picked the car, my partner did all the paper work and we were off. During whole journey I was thinking about my dad's words he said to me, the last time we met. I called my uncle on the way to enquire about dad's health, he said, my dad was suffering from heart disease from a couple of months, but never told you because I was busy fighting my own battle. He didn't want to be an obstacle in my success.

> 所以,我从新走进这世界,准备面对一场苦战,谨慎地去面对任何事情.我变成了一块石头.我联系我的伙伴并且说服 ta 和我重新开始之前的起步项目.我们昼夜不歇的工作.一个好的业务计划,带来了很多的客户和投资人.我像一个滚动的火球,把挡在我道路上的一切摧毁掉.在一个日子的清晨,我的伙伴打电话给我,带着超激动的语气说,"兄弟,我们做到了,我们做到了.美国的一家公司对我的项目感兴趣,第一个订单高达 2600 万,窝草".那会,我在咖啡馆喝着咖啡,激动得快留下了幸福的泪水.我打了一辆车,直奔办公室.我感到满满的兴奋和能量,在回去路上我想着该给一样什么样的礼物给这个最成功的人.我决定送 ta 一辆豪车,当现在钱不是问题的时候.我打给我一个在奔驰上班的朋友,问他那里是否还有可以立刻支付的 S-class 车.ta 觉得很震惊,但我承诺在以后会告诉 ta 所有的整一件事,而我现在只想找一辆车.我到到达办公的地方,走进办公室,我最好的朋友冲向我,抱着我哭.我第一眼看见 ta 在办公室感动很惊讶.然后 ta 说,"你爸心脏病发,很严重".那一刻,我的心又碎了.我感到自己在旋转,脑子一片空白.一会过后,我以后是他们的恶作剧,但他们是认真的.该怎么做,我脑子都停止了思考.我最好的朋友和我的伙伴把我推进一辆离开公司的车.我们大概离开这城市,这时那个奔驰销售员打电话给我告诉我奔驰准备好了.我朋友坚持让我取车回去,让我爸在最后的时光开心一次.我们去到展厅,取到那辆车,我伙伴签订了所有的合同然后我们离开了那地方.在路上我一直想着最后一次见面,我父亲对我说的话.我在路上打电话给我叔叔询问父亲的病情,得知父亲在几个月前就有心脏问题,但 ta 从没告诉我,因为我当时忙于打着自己的战斗.ta 不希望成为我成功路上的障碍.

I reached the hospital, I saw my dad lying on the bed. He was unconscious all this time, but when I brushed my hand against his head, he opened his eyes, which was a miracle like thing. He was looking at me, I showed him the Mercedes-Benz keys and said, “dad, I have finally made it, you have always given me everything, which money can never buy. You have always bought me things, I always dreamt of, today your son has bought you something you always dreamt of” handing him the keys, there were tears in his eyes. I was there with my dad & mom ever since, I didn't want to miss any moment of happiness with them, I wanted to see them happy always. After two weeks, dad got discharged. We went home happily, in the S-Class. He was so happy, like a baby. I had never seen him so happy. After that we enjoyed every moment of life, and business grew up & up after that.

## 你见过最伤心的事是什么?

Date: December 05 2017

Two police officers in uniform walked into the store just as we were getting ready to close for the night.

> 在我们准备下班的那一晚,两个警察穿着制服走了进来

One of the men walked up and set a plastic bag and a roll of film on the counter in front of me.

> 一个警察走过来,把一个塑料袋和一卷的底片摆在我面前

Inside the plastic bag was a small black camera. The camera was smashed up pretty bad.

> 在塑料袋里面有一个黑色的小摄像头.摄像头被摔得很破碎.

“There is a roll of film in this camera that we need to get out and develop if possible. Is this something you can help with?”

> "这个相机里面有一些照片我们想尽可能的修复.你可以帮到我们吗?"

I was about 19 years old at the time, working in a photography store at a mall in rural Southwest Virginia, right on the edge of the Appalachian mountains.

> 那年我才 19 岁,在 Virginia 州的西北部的一个市场的摄影店里工作,刚好在阿巴拉契亚山脉的边缘.

“We have a film lab at the police station but our equipment is broken at the moment. We need to get this film developed as soon as possible. And, we don’t know how to get this out of the camera without ruining the film.”

> "我们有照片仪器在警察局里面,但是仪器现在坏掉了.我们需要尽可能快的修复这些照片.我们不知道怎么把照片从相机里面拿出来而又不损坏照片."

Since the camera was broken, the film was stuck in the camera in the middle of the roll. If the camera was working, the film could be wound back into the roll and protected from the light when the back cover of the camera was opened.

> 从相机被损坏开始,底片就卡在相机的圆筒处.如果相机在工作,当打开相机的时候,底片就会缩进那个圆筒保护底片不受曝光.

If they opened the camera to take out the film as it was, any pictures that were taken would immediately be ruined once the undeveloped film was exposed to the light.

> 如果 ta 们打开相机而且把底片拿出来,所有的照片会被曝光损坏.

We did have a small black box to use for this exact type of situation. The box was sealed so no light would get inside. I could put the broken camera inside the sealed box, reach my hands through an opening on each side of the box, slip my hands into black gloves that were attached inside, and open the camera to remove the film without any light damaging it before it was developed.

> 我们有一个小黑盒来处理这种特殊的情况.这个盒子是密封的,不会有光可以进入内部.我可以把相机放到盒子里面,用手打开盒子的一边,穿戴黑手套,打开相机把底片拿出来,在没有任何曝光的情况下,进行修复.

I told him I could help. No problem at all.

> 我告诉 ta 我可以帮忙.一点也不麻烦.

“Did you hear about the plane crash this afternoon? We recovered the camera from the crash site. We don’t know what is on the roll of film. Are you okay with developing those pictures for us?”

> "你听说了下午的坠机吧?我们从坠机地点发现这台相机.我们不知道里面有什么.在这样的情况下,你愿意帮我们洗出这些照片吗?"

I am sure there are people who would say ‘no’ to that question. I was not one of those people. Of course I would help. And I was curious to see what was on the roll of film.

> 我知道很多人会说"不愿意".但我不是很多人中的那个.当然我可以帮忙,而且我很好奇在相机里面的是什么.

“Can you develop this other roll of film as well? These are the pictures we took at the crash site. They are quite gruesome though. The pictures of the crash, before the bodies were taken to the morgue. And there are a few pictures from the morgue as well. It really is okay if you would prefer not to develop these, but we figure it doesn’t hurt to ask.”

> "你还能把其他的照片洗出来吗?这些都是我们从坠机地点拿回来的.这有点阴森.这些照片是在尸体放到停尸间前在坠机地点照的.也有几张在停尸间的.如果你不想去处理这些照片,我们也理解,但我们觉得需要征求一下你的意见"

I had been working all day so I hadn’t seen the news. A small private plane crashed just a few miles from the store where I was working. It wasn’t that uncommon for plane crashes like this to happen. The Appalachian mountains were not easy for small planes to fly in and out of.

> 因为我一整天都在工作,没留意新闻.一架小的私人飞机坠毁在我工作地点的几英里外.这是一件不寻常的坠机事件.这里的山脉不是小型飞机可以飞进飞出的

Since the photo equipment at the police station wasn’t working, if we were not able to help them, they would have to drive over an hour away to the next closest photography store. Or wait however many weeks it would take for them to get their equipment fixed.

> 自从警察局里的照片仪器不能使用,如果我们不能帮上忙,ta 们只有驱车一个小时才能达到最近的摄影店处理.或者 ta 们等几个星期修好自己的仪器.

I told him I would help. No problem at all.

> 我告诉 ta 我可以帮忙.一点也不麻烦.

My coworker offered to help as well. She took the camera out of the plastic bag to start working on removing the roll of film while I grabbed the second roll to start developing the photos from the crash site.

> 我的同事也乐意帮忙.在我开始处理从坠机地点带回来的底片的时候,ta 从塑料袋里面拿出相机开始着手怎么把胶片移出来.

The pictures came through one at a time, each one more horrific than the last.

> 照片一张一张的洗出来,一张比一张令人可怕.

The plane crashed in the middle of the woods, barreling through layers of trees before it hit the ground. Plane parts were everywhere. There was hardly anything left of the plane itself.

> 飞机坠毁在丛林中间,在 ta 坠毁前撞毁了一些树木.飞机残骸分散各地.飞机几乎全部解体.

There were pictures of each of the bodies of the four men who were on the plane. Their bodies were large, covered in blood. I could see their limbs disconnected and lying on the ground, far from where the bodies were. The men’s bodies were torn to pieces, just like the plane was. It was surreal.

> 那里是四个在飞机上的尸体照片.ta 们身体浮肿,被血迹覆盖.我可以看见 ta 们的肌体断开而且掉落在他们尸体远处.ta 们的身体变成一块又一块,就像那架飞机一样.就像超现实画布一样.

I checked back on the equipment settings a few times while the pictures were being developed, but I couldn’t look at all of them as they came through the machine.

> 在处理照片期间我查看仪器的设定几次,但我不能在它们晒出来的时候,一一查看照片.

The last time I checked to see how close the roll was to being finished, I saw the last picture on the roll come through. It was a picture of one of the bodies lying on a table at the morgue.

> 最后一次我去看处理了多少照片时,我看见最后一张晒出来了.是一张尸体躺在停尸间桌子上的图片.

I packaged up the stack of pictures in an envelope with a huge lump in my throat. All of a sudden I wanted to un-see everything I just saw. But it was too late.

> 我哽咽着把这些照片放进信封.在这一刻,我不想看见刚才看到的任一张照片.但,太迟了.

As I handed the envelope to the police officer, my coworker handed me the second roll that she was able to remove from the broken camera.

> 我把信封交给警察时,我同事把 ta 能相机里面拿出来的底片递给我.

As I developed the film from the camera, I saw there were only four pictures taken on that roll of film.

> 当我晒出来自相机的照片,相机只照了很少的几张照片.

The first two were pictures of the four men standing next to their plane. Fishing gear in hand, huge joyful smiles on their faces, arms wrapped around each other for a group photo before taking off for a weekend fishing trip. All four of them looked like they were in their mid- to late-50s.

> 前两张照片是四个人站在 ta 们的飞机旁的合影.手里拿着鱼竿,脸上挂着大大的笑脸,臂膀相互放在彼此的肩膀上,在一周的钓鱼旅行结束前照下这张合影.ta 们看起来都是 50-60 左右.

The third was a photo taken on the plane by one of the men sitting in the front seat of the two men who were sitting in the back seat.

> 第三张照片是在飞机上照的,两个人坐在飞机前座,一个坐在后座.

The last photo was of the plane’s control panel. When the plane started to go down, before it crashed, one of the men took a picture of the control panel. He must have taken the photo knowing there may be a chance that the camera would survive the crash, and there would be a small glimpse of what went wrong.

> 最后一张照片是飞机的仪表盘.当飞机开始坠落的时候,在坠毁前拍摄的,一个人的照了一张仪表盘的照片.ta 肯定知道这张照片有可能在相机里面幸存下来,揭示这场事故的一些起因.

A small piece of evidence to help explain to their loved ones what happened.

> 一小块证据去证明 ta 们家人所爱的他们发生了什么事.

I thought about those men for months. I wondered how long they knew each other. How many fishing trips had they been on together? What did they say to each other when they knew the plane was going down? Were they at peace with their lives before everything ended so abruptly?

> 我在那个月都想起那些人. 我想知道 ta 们认识彼此多久了,ta 们一起度过了多少次钓鱼旅行?在飞机坠毁前,ta 们相互说着什么?ta 们在生活唐突结束前是不是平静?

This was over 15 years ago and I still see each of those pictures so vividly in my mind as I type this.

> 这是 15 年前的事了,当我写下这些时,那些人还很清晰的在我脑海里面映现.

Those last four photos were by far the saddest thing I have ever seen. I still remember the smiles on their faces. So much joy came through those photos, showing a group of close friends excited to spend the weekend together doing something they love.

> 那里最后一张照片,是我见过最忧伤的事.我依然记得他们的面容.洋溢着欢乐的照片,几个好友花上一个星期时间一起去做他们喜欢的事.

But they never made it to their destination, and they never made it back home.

> 但 ta 们从来没达到终点,而且 ta 们再也没能够回家了.

I found myself constantly thinking about those men and the story that was ingrained in my mind from the pictures I saw. I did not know them. But, I did know they looked so happy. I did eventually find peace knowing they left this life full of joy, surrounded by close friends, doing something they loved.

> 我发现我时常不断的想起这些人和我从这些照片里面看见的事故.我不认识他们,但我的确知道 ta 们看起来很开心.我偶尔在发现 ta 们让自己的人生充满欢乐会心情平静下来,围绕在好朋友的身边,做着 ta 们喜欢的事情.

Imagine this.

You are J.

> 你是 J.

J wakes up at 6:30 am, brushes his teeth, takes a shower, eats breakfast, drives to work, finishes up at 5 pm, drives home, watches a little telly, eats dinner, reads a book, and goes to sleep.

> J 在 6:30 起床,刷牙,洗个澡,吃早餐,开车去上班,在下午 5 点结束工作,开车回家.看一会电视,吃个晚饭,看一下书,然后去睡觉

See anything wrong with J’s day? No?

> 看见 J 的一天有什么出错了没? 没 ?

How about the fact J didn’t wake up to a blaring alarm clock, turn it off and go back to sleep thereby winding up late for work - only to have a flat tire on the way. J didn’t get reprimanded by his boss who told him to stay over-time. J didn’t have to finally leave his workplace around 7 pm, take a taxi over to the Wal-Mart Tire Repair Service to collect his car, only to realize he left his wallet at home, and J didn’t finally roll into his driveway at 10 pm, just in time to watch in horror as his house burned down because he left the gas on.

> 那么事实是 J 没有在闹钟响起的时候醒过来,把闹钟关掉而又继续睡,上班迟到的路上-车胎又被扎破了.J 没有接到经常要求 J 加班的老板的谴责,最终他不用在工作地方待到晚上 7 点,打的去 Wal-mart 轮胎修理店取 ta 的车,才发现自己把带钱包忘在家里面了.而 J 也没能在晚上 10 点在回家的路上,所以回到的时候,刚好看着 ta 的房子被烧毁,因为 ta 忘记关闭煤气了.

## 你妈给你最好的建议是什么?在你成年之后感受到 ta 的好处没?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the best advice your mother ever gave you? Do you feel it has benefited you as an adult?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-advice-your-mother-ever-gave-you-Do-you-feel-it-has-benefited-you-as-an-adult/answer/Laurel-Mint?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: December 08 2017

Don’t tell just anyone your deepest dreams, desires, and goals.

> 不要告诉任何人你最想实现的梦想,最想实现的心愿,最想实现的目标.

When my mom first gave me this advice, I was in middle school. The advice was totally out of left field. I was sitting at the dining table doing my homework, my mom stirring her coffee across from me, looking happier than usual. When I meet her eyes and smile, she smiles back and asks me, “Do your friends know what you want to be when you grow up?”

> 当我妈第一次给我这个建议的时候,我已经上初中了.这个建议完全是一个不寻常的操作.当时我坐在饭桌前做着作业,我妈的咖啡撒到了我这边,看起来比平常更高兴.当我笑着看着 ta 的眼睛的时候,ta 微笑着问我,"你朋友知道你长大了想成为什么样的人没?",

Me: “They tell me I should be an artist…”

> 我:"ta 们告诉我,我应该成为一个艺术家..."

Mom: “Is that what you want to be?”

> 我妈:"这真的是你想成为的人吗?"

Me: “No.”

> 我: "不是"

Mom: “Do they know that?”

> 我妈: "ta 们知道你不想成为艺术家没?"

Me: “No.”

> 我:"不知道"

Mom: “Good. Don’t tell just anyone the things that make you happy and excited. Don’t tell every person you meet any of these things. Keep your hopes and dreams deep down.”

> 我妈:"很好.不要告诉任何人那些让你开心和兴奋的事情.不要告诉你遇到的任何一个人.把你的希望和梦想保留在最深处,留给自己."

Me: “Why?”

> 我:"为什么?"

Mom: “You’ll understand when you get older.”

> 我妈:"你长大就会知道了."

I remember thinking about that conversation for weeks. I didn’t talk to anyone about it. I just thought about it on my own. My mom is an amazing woman. At the time she gave me this advice, we were financially struggling and her patience was wearing thin. I was going through puberty. Our relationship was strained so I has concluded that her advice was the byproduct of a paranoid person’s way of thinking, and I brushed off my unsettled feelings. For whatever reason, even though I thought her advice was silly and that she was paranoid, I did exactly as she told me. Maybe I was superstitious?

> 我差不多一个星期都在想着这次谈话.我没有和任何人提起这个谈话.我想靠我自己去想明白.我妈是一个了不起的人.在这个时候,ta 给我这个建议,我们当时经济出现危机而 ta 的耐性也逐渐变差.我也正在青春期.我们之间的相处关系有点紧张,所以我怀疑这个想法是妄想症患者的副产品,我丢弃了所有的怀疑态度.出于一些莫名其妙的原因,即使我想 ta 的建议是愚蠢的而且 ta 有点妄想症,但我按照 ta 说的做了.或者是因为我迷信?

More than 15 years later, I finally understand. Often times, people are covetous. Not because they’re evil but because they’re lonely. They want to put a spin on your narrative, your triumphs, your struggles. In appropriating your life through their projected commentary, they become a part of it, and sometimes, taint it. Ever think about something so funny to you that you run and tell your loved one how hilarious such and such was and they don’t laugh at all? Or have you ever been very excited about something just to have it dashed by someone else dismissively because they are having a bad week? Dreams are fragile—when exposed to the air, they harden and crack very easily. If you incubate them long enough inside of you to take shape and become something living, nothing can break them. Sharing your dreams with the right person is like sharing a beautiful animal or child—only those who truly care about you know how crucial your dreams are, how valuable they are, and how fragile they are. Until you find these people, don’t take your dreams lightly and leave them up to the interpretation and expectations of others.

> 15 年后(一黑屏,N 年后,电影常规操作),最终我明白了我妈说的话.通常,我们都是很贪婪的.不是因为我们是恶魔,而是因为我们是孤独的.旁人围绕喜欢在你的故事,你的胜利,你的挣扎中.在你人生某些阶段经历过 ta 们的评论,ta 们就会机会成为其中的一部分,有些时候,甚至污染(改变)了你.难道你没试过你想到一个很有趣的东西,然后你跑去告诉你喜欢的那些人,而 ta 们根本没有笑?或者你对某些事感到很兴奋因为某些人处于一个槽糕的星期而对你的轻蔑一笑而感到失落?当梦想接触空气时,变得易碎,ta 们轻易的变得冷漠,然后破裂.如果你在你内心孕育 ta 们足够久,直到你变得坚硬或者成为举足轻重的人时,没人可以打碎你的梦想.跟对的人分享你的梦想就像分享一个漂亮的奇珍异兽或者孩子,那些真正在乎你,知道你梦想对你的重要性,知道你梦想的价值,知道 ta 们有多么易碎.知道遇到这些人之前,不要把你的梦想说出,向其他人解析或期盼他们.

Date: December 10 2017

When my daughter was 15 years old I noticed she wasn’t sleeping at night and that she would be up all night chatting. I assumed it was with her girlfriends. In the morning she was so tired. She was doing well academically. Her moods and appearance changed: she didn’t wash her hair, she got angry more often, she would slam her bedroom door and the “girl talks” we used to have just disappeared. She no longer needed me.

> 当女儿 15 岁的时候,我发现她会整晚在聊天而不睡觉.我想她是和她朋友之间的聊天.在早上,她看起来很疲倦.在学业上,她做得不错.她的情绪和外表时常变化:她没有洗头,比往常更容易生气,她会把房门摔上,我们之间的那种女生谈话也消失了.她不再需要我了.

I knew there was something wrong but assumed it was just “normal teenage angst”…it wasn’t. One night I was determined to find out what was going on…so yes….I went on a night raid of her room when she was chatting on line. And yes I caught her in the act…but it wasn’t with her girlfriends from school…it was with a 27 year old man from the Netherlands who at the time told her he was 18 years old.

> 我知道有某些事情出错了,但我以为那只是普通的青春期反叛而已.一天晚上,我下定决心去查个究竟.然后,一天晚上当她在线聊天的时候,我突然撞进她的房间.是的,我发现她在演...(something upspeakable?)但不是和她的在学校里面的女同学,而是一个来自荷兰 27 岁当时却告诉她只有 17 岁的老男人(27 岁的 old man? That is hurt)

She told me through tears that she was in love with this man and going to marry him. I absolutely flipped! I took away her phone and lap top and wifi. She then ran into the kitchen and cut both wrists several times. When I got there I instantly removed the knife from her and wrapped her wrists with gauze. I then took her to her room and called a crisis line. This was followed up by counselling, notifying the police as directed by law and her school principal to put on restrictions. I was told to restrict wifi for 6 months then gradually introduce it again. We found out that there was another 19-year-old girl at her school that this man was also having cybersex with without my daughter's knowledge.

> 我女儿留着泪告诉我她喜欢这个男的,而且想嫁给他.我当时绝对懵逼状态.我拿走她的手机和手提电脑和 WIFI.然后她走进厨房割脉自尽.当我走进厨房,我立刻移走了她手中的刀同时用纱布包扎她的伤口.我把她抱到她的房间,然后打了急救电话.接下来是咨询,根据来自法律部门的警察同志和她的学校校长的指示对她进行了限制.我被告知要在将来的 6 个月时间限制 WIFI 才能从新开通 WIFI 给我女儿使用.我们发现在我女儿不知道的情况下,那狗贼在学校里还与另一个 19 岁的女孩进行网络上的性行为(网交? I don't know how to translate that).

I spoke with the individual and told him to stay away from her as he already did enough damage, that she was a minor to stop depriving her of her youth…he told me that “When she turns 18 there is nothing you can do!”.

> 我和他进行了个人交谈,叫他在造成这些伤害后,不要靠近我的女儿.她还是一个女孩子,不能让她失去了青春....而他只和我说:"等她 18 岁的时候,你干涉不了任何事情."

I thought that I had put enough measures in place and that by talking to her and getting her counselling that all would be well. She was doing well in school and got a scholarship to one of the best universities here. That spring we got a condo for her to live in, a room mate whom she had been friends with since elementary school, furniture, a car…everything that would make her transition easier.

> 我以为和她交谈之后我已经做足了所有的措施,而且向她确保所有的东西会变好的.她在学校里面做得很好,还拿到了在那里最好的大学中的一家大学的奖学金.那年春天我们给她住进一间分期的公寓,一个从她初中一直以来都是同学的室友,家具,一辆车...所有的东西让她的过渡更轻松一点.

On Saturday July 1, I went away with my husband for the weekend and before we left we had breakfast together with my daughter. She was just radiant. I complimented her that day, gave her a hug and a kiss and asked if there was something she wanted me to bring back for her. “Oh, don’t worry about me Mom…have fun…I love you.” I remember exchanging hand heart kisses through the window.

> 7 月 1 日星期六,在我和丈夫出外,在外出前我们还和她一起吃了早餐.她精神很好.我那天还夸奖了她,和她拥抱吻别,问她还要我们给她买一些其他东西没."不需要担心我,老妈...玩得开心点...我爱你."我记得她给在窗外给了我一个手心飞吻.

When we returned Sunday morning the front door was open and she was missing.We thought she was kidnapped. Her friends did an on-line media campaign to find her. Jewelry, money that I was saving for her school year in a bank account, electronics… and her passport all missing… She was gone…

> 当我们星期天早上回来,房子的门是开着的,而她不见了踪影.我们以为她被绑架了.她的朋友在网上发动了寻找她的活动.珠宝,给她存着上学的费用,电子设备,还有她的护照都不见了,她也不见了.

We called police and put a missing person report out. Six long, heart breaking, sleepless nights later my daughter was located in the Netherlands….alive!

> 我们打电话给警察局和发布了失踪声明.在她失踪后六个漫长,心碎,不眠的夜晚后,我们的女儿在荷兰被发现...还活着.

It was determined that she ran away to the Netherlands to this man. He is 30 years old, unemployed living in his father's one-room apartment, unkept and obese. For 3 years she was secretly sending him money.

> 发现她跑去荷兰是为了那个男的.他已经 30 岁了,失业居住在他父亲的一间室公寓里面,不修边幅和肥胖.3 年来,她一直瞒着我们给他寄钱.

My daughter went out on only a few dates at 17 but never really had a boyfriend. She was shy socially, a little overweight, and so very beautiful to me and everyone that knew her. She had a lot of self-esteem issues as most girls her age would have but she was kind, considerate and a warm-hearted person. All this changed overnight.

> 我女儿在 17 岁的时候只出去过几次约会,还没有男朋友.她在社交比较害羞,轻微的肥胖,但对于我和认识她的都觉得她很漂亮.她有着和她同年级的女孩子的虚荣,但她很热情,为他人着想,一个热心肠的人.而这些在一晚时间里面都颠覆了.

What did he teach her? He taught her to HATE… to hate her family, her friends, her grandparents…and even God. And to hate me the most because I SAID NO. All her friends, family and teachers tried to convince her to return to no avail. She blocked everyone.

> 他教会了她什么?他教会了她去憎恨...去憎恨她的家庭,她的朋友,她的父辈们,甚至是宗教.而她最憎恨我,因为我对她说了不.她所有的朋友,老师尝试去说服她回来,不要被人利用.她拉黑了所有的人.

He controls all her Internet security on her e-mails and occasionally e-mails me from her e-mails, taunting me, “She’s never going to come back to you. You’re disgusting. You’re a control freak. What kind of mother are you? You’ve lost her forever. Go to the police, I’ve been in hotter fires than this!” Apparently this is what Internet predators do especially to the parents of their victims. And not once…not once has he ever professed his love for her.

> 他控制了她的所有邮箱安全密码,偶尔发一封邮件来嘲弄我,"她永远不会回到你身边的.你是一个恶心的控制狂.你算得上是哪种母亲?你永远的失去了她.去警察局里面,我会变得比现在更红的(shit,过气网红事件?)"显然这是网络犯罪者对受害者父母做的.没有一次,没有一次他公开说他喜欢她.

They both told police that I was trying to kill her, that I held her down and cut her wrists, that I locked her in her room, that she ran away to him to be safe that I was too controlling and she needed her freedom because she is 18 years old. Her aunt, uncle, parents also flew there to try to talk with her only to be met by police and a closed door.

> 他们两个告诉警察,我尝试去干掉她,我把她推倒,把她的手腕割开,我把她锁在房间里面,因为我控制欲她逃到他那里才会变得安全,她需要自由,因为她已经满 18 岁了.她的阿姨,叔叔,父母飞到那边尝试去她交谈,但我们遇到的只有警察和一扇关着的门.

What is my Biggest Mistake?…Not putting a GPS on her phone and a monitoring system on the laptop when she was initially given electronics and access to the Internet as a child. You see my daughter had told me what I wanted to hear…”Mom I had Internet safety training; you need to trust me”…”Mom, you can trust me I promise I’m not online with him anymore”…and I tried to trust her but then came the fights… and the mistrust. I did not know what to do? You see…there was a stranger living in her bedroom… and I didn’t know. She was given our trust and her privacy. Our lives are now shattered.

> 我最大的错误?没把一个 GPS 放到她的手机里面,没有在她小孩子的时候使用电脑时安装监控系统.你看,我女儿对我说了我想听见的东西..."老妈,我已经经过了互联网安全训练;你需要去相信我"..."老妈,你可以相信我,我保证我不会再和他通信了"...而我尝试去相信她,然后得到的是争吵,不信任.我不知道该去做什么.你知道吗?一个陌生的男的生活在她的房间里,而我竟然对此毫不知情.她拥有我们的信任和她的个人隐私.现在我们的生活支离破碎.

What is my Biggest Regret? …Love and hug your children every day and tell them you love them… Love them even more when you are upset, angry or fighting with them. Set aside your anger, put your arms around them and hug them. Just hug them! Because when they’re fighting and arguing the hardest that’s when they are hurting the most!

> 我最后悔是什么?...每一天爱着和拥抱你的孩子和告诉他们你爱他们,爱他们即使你烦恼,生气或和他们争吵的时候.把你的脾气摆在一边,把你的手臂环绕这他们,拥抱着他们,静静的抱着他们.因为当他们越争吵和辩论的时候,那是因为那一刻 ta 们伤得最深.

A Note for Parents: They initially met on INSTAGRAM when she was 15 years old. That then led to internet meetings on a music site called SING. From there he encouraged her to go into chat rooms like LINE, then he bought her video games to play on-line with him, that turned into a sexual relationship. In Canada it is illegal to have sexual relations with minors on-line. The law defines a minor as being under 18 years of age and if the age gap is greater than 5 years the individual could be facing a 10-year jail term. The Police diligently investigated the case but could not obtain chat logs. There is no time limit to lay charges for historical sexual assault on a minor.

> 一个给父母的建议:他们最初相遇在 Ins 在她 15 岁的时候.然后在一个音乐网站 SING 里面.从那里开始,他怂恿她到聊天室聊天,然后他买给她一个电子游戏和他在网上玩,然后发生性关系.在加拿大,和未成年网交是违法的.法律定义在 18 岁以下,而且双方年龄差距在 5 岁以上,那么将会面临 10 年的监禁.警方努力调查,但无法获取聊天记录.对未成年人进行侵犯的指控没有时间限制.

Who is this Online Predator? He is a programmer/hacker who helped write code for an INSTAGRAM Private API wrapper that can essentially access private user information from the repository. We believe he had access to all our daughters personal information (e.g. date of birth, school, address, phone number) even before they met on INSTAGRAM. At the time of our daughters disappearance all our emails were being hacked, our bank accounts, our phones on a daily basis for two months. Our correspondence with police, investigators, court documents, medical documents, flight itinerary to the Netherlands were all compromised as were our Amazon and PayPal accounts. He knew everything!

> 谁在网上寻找目标?他是一个帮助 Ins 写代码的程序猿/黑客(shit),听过一个私有 API 接口可以从存储库中获取的用户的个人信息.我相信他设置在他们在 ins 相遇前都能获取我们女儿的所有私人信息(例如 出生日期,学校,地址,手机号码).从我们女儿失踪开始,我们所有的邮件就被黑掉了,银行账户,手机等差不多有 2 个月每天都这样.我们与警方的信件，调查人员，法庭文件，医疗文件，我们在亚马逊和 Paypal 飞往荷兰的航班航程.他知道所有的东西.(这就有点玄幻了,不好意思)

Why am I writing this? My daughter loves Quora. I am hoping that with enough views I can get this message, and your comments to her:

> 为什么我写这个? 我女儿喜欢 Quora,我希望这个回答能得到足够多的人浏览我能传送这个消息,你们留言给她:

”My darling precious child, I love you more than words can express. I am truly sorry that I didn’t try harder to listen to you and that I didn’t hug you when you needed me the most. I am not going to try to force you to come back home. Your life is yours. We all miss you and love you unconditionally, and we would welcome you back with open arms. Please be safe. Please, please call me, I am waiting by the phone… I Love You Always and Forever …Mommy OXOX”

> "亲爱的孩子,没有任何语言可以表达我爱你.真的很对不起我没有更努力的去倾听你的想法,在你最需要拥抱的时候没有去拥抱你.我不会去强制你回家.人生是你自己的.我们全部人都很想你且无条件的爱着你,我们张开双臂欢迎你回来.请照顾好自己.一定,一定要打电话给我,我会一直守在电话旁边...我爱你呀,从之前从以后.... 妈妈 xxxx"

UPDATE: That man called me . He admitted that she was a minor at the time but could not stop the relationship. He wanted me to take down this post in order for me to speak with my daughter. I did as he asked. When I called to speak with my daughter, no one picked up. I have since restored my post. I may have lost my daughter to an online predator, but it will be my mission in life to make sure that no other family has to ever endure the pain and hardship my family has, that no other child is exploited as mine has been. Thank you for your stories, your advice and your prayers… parents please learn from my mistakes and hold your children dear, and please share this story about my beautiful daughter with everyone you know!

> 更新: 那个男的和我联系了.他承认我女儿在那会还没成年,但他不想结束关系.他让我撤掉这篇文章用来获取和我女儿通话的机会.我按照他的要求做了.当我打电话给我女儿的时候,没人接电话.所以我重新推送了这篇文章.我或者已经在那些人里面遗失了我的女儿,但我有责任区确保没有别的家庭在遭遇到我们现在的这种痛苦,没有别的孩子像我们的孩子一下被侵害到.谢谢你们的故事,你们的建议和你们的祈祷,父母们请在我的错误中学到一些东西保护好你们的孩子.同时向你身边的每个人分享这个关于我女儿的故事.

## 到目前,你高光的一天是?

**_Thanks a lot everyone for the 15000+ upvotes. How I wish I could talk to you all!_**

> **_谢谢大家 15000+的点赞.真希望我可以和你们聊一下_**

I come from a city in India called Dehradun. In fourth grade, we were compulsorily made to sit in a pair of a girl and boy in the school. So, my boy partner was a very innocent and helpful type of guy. In the lunch break, he always used to ask me to eat from his lunch box before having his first bite. And we had a class for cursive writing practice, in which whatever I could not write, he used to hold my hand and make me write the whole sentence sometimes.

> 我来自印度一个叫 Dehradun 的城市.在四年级,我们学校强制男女同桌.所以,我的男同桌是很笨(天真,你要的话)和乐于助人的一个男孩.在午间休息的时候,他通常习惯先问我要从他的饭盒拿什么东西在 ta 还没开始吃第一口的之前.我们有一门书法练习的课,但我不会写,通常 ta 会握住我的手,有时还会教我写一整段.(单身,不是一天造成的 泪目)

This was the time I started feeling something different. I did not understand what was going on. It felt ticklish inside everytime he helped me write. So, sometimes during the class, I used to hold his hand the entire time and he held it tight as well.

> 那会我开始感觉有些不一样了.但我不清楚是什么事情在发生.在 ta 每一次教我写字的时候,我会感到慌乱(心中的那条老狗,砰砰乱撞).在课堂间,我整节课习惯握住 ta 的手而 ta 也会紧紧的握住我的手.

Then came by birthday. Before distributing the chocolates to entire class, I gave it to him first. He kissed me on my right cheek and thanked me for it, I remember well. That day, I saved ten chocolates from the pack that my mom had given me. And everyday, I used to take one for him and he would kiss me on my cheek which felt good in a different way.

> 来到生日的时候.在给全班发巧克力之前,我先给了 ta 一块.ta 吻了我的右脸颊同时谢谢我给了 ta 巧克力,我记得可牢了(好可爱呀你).那天,我从我妈给我的包裹里面留下了 10 条巧克力.每一天,我会把一块巧克力给他,而 ta 会吻我的脸颊,我不同往常的觉得这感觉很好.

My chocolates finished but I asked him for a kiss everyday and he never rejected. Then, after the Christmas break, when we met again, he said that he saw a movie in which the hero and heroine were doing ‘this’. And then he demonstrated it to me by pressing his lips against mine. And I was like wow.

> 我的巧克力给完了,但我还是每天叫 ta 来吻我,而 ta 从没拒绝过我(女流氓).然后,在圣诞节假期后,当我们再次相遇,ta 说 ta 看了一部电影(FBI warning?)里面男猪脚和女猪脚做着"这个".然后 ta 向我演示了他们做的事情,ta 的嘴唇爬上了我的嘴唇.而我表示震惊(联合国表示严正谴责).

We were just kids back then and it was a weird feeling that I felt for the first time. Then we used to do it a lot- in the first lecture, the lunch break and after school and I used to give him all the chocolates that my father bought for me. My father had labour export business back then so he used to bring a variety of chocolates for me.

> 我们那时还是小屁孩,第一次我感觉有点奇怪.然后我们开始频繁的接吻-在第一节演讲,午间休息和放学后.我通常把我爸买给我所有的巧克力都送给他.当时我爸有一个劳动力输出的生意,他通常给我买各种各样的巧克力.

One day during the lunch break when we were in the school garden, our sports sir caught us kissing and took us to the principal. He told everything to the principal. And the principal asked us ‘what were you two doing?’ And because we were so stupid back then that we did not even know the term ‘kissing’, we started to demonstrate in front of the principal which led the sports sir push him away from me and both of them- the principal and sports sir started to shout at him very loudly. I had tears in my eyes. That day, though he did not cry, he was very sad. I caught his hand before leaving for home that day and dropped him till the bus.

> 一天,在午休时间,当我们在学校的花园里面.体育老师看见了我们接吻,把我们带到了校长那里(来自单身狗的恶意).体育老师把所有事情都告诉了校长.校长问我们"你们俩当时在做什么?",因为当时我们太笨了,甚至都不知道那叫接吻.所以我们在校长面前从新接吻了一次(牛掰了,我的姐),校长和体育老师把他推开了.校长和体育老师开始大声去责骂 ta.我都快哭了.那天,尽管 ta 没哭,但 ta 很伤心.在回家前我拉住 ta 的手,直到公交到了才放开.

The next day, he did not come to school nor did he come any day after that. I became very sad. I asked our class teacher why did he stop coming to school to which she said that he was removed from school and his parents sent him to boarding school.

> 第二天,ta 没有来学校了,从那一天起,ta 再也没来过学校了.我很伤心.我问我们的老师为什么 ta 没有来上学了.老师说 ta 被学校开除了,而 ta 的父母把 ta 送到了寄宿学校.

I never stopped thinking about him. Our separation has been like a childhood trauma to me.

> 我一直都想着 ta.我们的分离对于我就像是童年的一个创伤.

All this happened back in 2006. Whichever temple my parents took me to, I always prayed that he would come back to me. Always. I waited. I never could imagine any other guy as my boyfriend. After tenth grade, when I started looking for him, I could not find him anywhere on the internet and someone else lived in the place where he used to live.

> 这些全都发生在 2006 年.不论父母带我去哪个寺庙,我都祈祷 ta 能够回到我身边.一直,我都在等待.我不能想象其他人成为我的男朋友.在 10 年级后,我开始寻找 ta,我从网上的任何地方和 ta 之前生活的地方的邻居也找不到 ta 的任何踪迹.

And then last week, I got a follow request on Instagram and I cannot explain the feeling I had. For two days, I couldn't stop smiling and blushing. Prayers do go up and blessings do come down. We are set to meet this weekend. I'm not really nervous because I feel like we are meant for each other. I just hope that he's single.

> 然后上个星期,我在 Ins 上收到了一个别人关注我的消息,我不能表达我当时的感觉.在那两天,我不能自已的笑着和脸红.祈祷的应验了,愿望开始落实.我们打算这个星期会面.我不太紧张因为我感觉我们是天生一对.我希望 ta 是单身狗.

Edit 1- We've been texting almost eight to ten hours a day. By now, we know a lot about each other about what happened with us after the separation day. However, he told me that there are some things he would like to tell me in person. I wonder what those things are. I also was stupid enough to call and ask him if he was single to which he laughed and said yes. I asked because his profile picture was with some other girl. By the way, his number starts with a ‘+44’ so I can guess where he has been. He is coming here for a wedding and he will arrive post-evening at the Delhi Airport. Our meeting is set for tomorrow evening. I'm typing this edit on Saturday, 04/11/17. Few of you asked me to keep you all posted with the updates. I will darlings. Thanks for all the love.

> 更新 1-我们差不多 1 天有 8 个小时都在发送消息给对方.现在,我们更了解在我们分开那一天之后发生了什么事.不论怎样,ta 告诉我有一些事情,ta 想亲自告诉我.我很好奇是什么事情.我也傻得可以的打电话去问 ta 是不是单身,ta 笑着说是.我问起是因为我看见 ta 的头像有另一个女孩的存在.随便说一句,ta 的号码是"+44"开头的,我可以大概猜测到 ta 在哪个地方.ta 来这边为了出席一个婚礼.ta 会在 Delhi 航线晚间到达这边.我们的见面定在明天晚上.我这个更新是在 2017 年 11 月 04 是星期六晚写的.你们当中的一些吃瓜群众要我持续更新.我会的,亲,谢谢你们的喜爱.

Edit 2- Today(05/11) morning, when my father went out for a morning walk, I spoke to my mom about my childhood kisser(let's call him ‘A’). My mom was a little bit shocked for why I would ask her about A all of a sudden. I told her that it strikes me all of a sudden out of nowhere. She told me the entire thing. She was called to the school the next day and so were A’s parents. A’s parents apologized repeatedly to my mom and the principal. The principal only saw A’s behavior at fault and he did not want any more of this in the school. He told A’s parents that A would have to leave because if he was doing such things in fourth grade, he could not imagine A’s potential doings in the future. That is the reason why A had to leave.

> 更新 2-今天(11 月 5 日),当我爸出外晨运的时候,我和我吗说起关于我童年里面的 kisser(就叫 ta 为 A 吧).我妈看起来有点震惊为什么我会突然间向她问起 A.我告诉她这然我无处不在的受到打击.她告诉我整一件事.第二天她和 A 的父母被学校叫过去了.A 的父母反复向我妈和校长道歉.校长只觉得是 A 的错,而他不想这样的事情再次在学校里面发生.他告诉 A 的父母,A 在 4 年级做出这样的事情,A 必须离开学校,他不能想象 A 在以后会做出什么事情来.这就是 A 为什么离开的原因了.

Later, A’s father requested my mom to not speak about this incident to anyone. “If I speak about this to other people, my daughter will not be looked at with respect in the future. So, why would I spoil my little girl’s future?” my mom had said. A’s mother had offered to compensate my mother as a sign of sorry but my mom rejected that because she thought that it would have been pathetic to do that. Their family decided to move to Mumbai after this incident because no other school would admit A in Dehradun.

> 晚一点.A 的爸爸请求我妈妈不要把这件事告诉其他任何人."如果我向其他人说了这件事,我的女儿会被不尊重的.我为什么要破坏我女儿的未来?"我妈这样说.A 的妈妈为了表示歉意向我妈妈提供补偿,但我妈拒绝了,因为我妈觉得这样做事可悲的.他们家庭在这件事之后因为没有其他学校肯接收 A 而决定搬离 Mumbai.

I told my mom that I am meeting A this evening. She said that the guy used to do that to you in school and that she would not stop me from meeting him because I can take my decisions as an adult but think a couple of times before meeting. “Mom, I have never said this to you but he was not alone responsible for whatever happened.”

> 我告诉我妈,我今晚和 A 见面.她说在那个男孩在学校对我做的事,而且不会阻拦我去见他,因为我可以像一个成年人一样为自己作出决定,但在见面前,要多想一下."妈,我之前没和你提起过,ta 不是要为之前发生的事唯一要承担责任的人"

I feel a little better after talking to my mom because I wanted to talk about this with her since a long time, since I had started to understand those weird feelings I used to get and probably ask her if she knew where had A disappeared. I never had the courage to do so but I did not want to do this behind her back because it would not have been right. Now I just hope that things go good with A. Also, for those of you asking the reason for my anonymity. See, even if one of the people who even remotely know me come to have knowledge of this, these things begin to spread like wildfire and then I and my parents will be judged for the rest of our lives. I am sorry. I so want to tell you all my name because after reading all the comments, I see a lot of positive people here and I want to talk to everyone of you. I love you all very much. I hope my reason for anonymity is justified. Thank you for the 3k+ upvotes.

> 在和我妈交谈之后,我感觉变好了一点,因为我很早就想和她谈了.自从我开始有那些奇怪的感觉或者可能去问她为什么 A 消失.但我从来没有那个勇气去做这些事,但我不想背着她去见 A,这对于我是一件不对的事.现在我只希望 A 那边一切顺利.同时,我为什么选择匿名的原因.嗯,即使只有一个人知道我有着这样的经历,这些事情会像野火一样蔓延,而我和我的父母在余生都要受到别人的评判.我很抱歉,在看过所有的留言后,我很希望把我的名字告诉你们,我在这里看到很多积极的人,我也想和你们的每一个交谈.我希望我的匿名理由足够充分.谢谢你们 3k+的赞

Edit 2A- I did meet him. Right now(10:17 pm on 05/11), I'm on my way home. I will type about this in detail first thing in the morning I promise. Thank you all for so much love. Also, the meeting was good. I'm not sure if this could be termed as ‘date’ but for me, it was a date.

> 更新 2A-我见过 ta 了.现在(11 月 05 日晚上 10:17),我正在回家的路上.我保证会在明早把细节更新上去.谢谢你们的喜爱.和 ta 见面很好.我不知道这算不算是'约会'的一种,但对于我,这就是个约会.

Edit 3- 06/11/17- I don't know where to begin from. Last evening, we were set to meet at a decided dine-in at 8 pm. I reached at 7:50 because I was a little excited and I kept checking my phone again and again since I don't wear a watch. I was well dressed and I put the best lipstick that I had. I did not put much make up though. The thing that I was afraid of was that he does not show up in shorts and a casual tee and hopefully, he didn't. He arrived 20 minutes late though and said sorry to which I said that it was okay. Butterflies butterflies inside me when he sat in front of me. Wow! What a moment it was. I wanted to cry out of joy and smile at the same time. I told him that I wrote about our little childhood story on quora and people loved it. I showed him the post and he smiled after that. Starting with the little talks, we later talked about his experience in the boarding school. About an hour later, he told me about how he used to stay depressed in the boarding school all the time. Then he started playing football there and that is what he used to do most his evenings. Later, his parents sent him to UK for graduation where he lives with his uncle's family and his cousin and they go to the same college. Thankfully, it was not awkward as a first date. "I'm sorry for what I did to you in school. I wanted to talk to you and clear things out and I tried to contact you on facebook but did not have the guts," he said. So, why could I not find him on facebook? Strange! Before leaving for home, I hugged him tight and said, "it was not your fault, A. I used to bring the chocolates, I'm sorry." He did not hesitate to lock his arms around me. I liked the smell of his hair though. Nice shampoo, I thought. We spoke on the phone last night for two hours before going to sleep. I think I am in love, probably. But, is he?

> 更新 3-2017 年 11 月 06 日-我不知从哪说起.昨晚,我们决定在晚上 8 点一起吃饭.我到那里已经是 7:50 分了,我有点激动,我没戴手表所以我一遍又一遍的查看我的手机.我穿着很好,涂上了最好的口红,化着淡妆.我担心的是 ta 没有穿着短裤,衬衣一脸希望的出现,但 ta 没有.ta 迟到了 20 分钟,ta 向我道歉,我说没所谓.当 ta 坐在我面前的时候,心里面有很多的蝴蝶在飞舞呀.wow.这是多么惊奇的一个时刻.我快开心得哭了出来的同时脸上挂着微笑.我告诉 ta,我在 Quora 上写我们小时候的故事,而读者都喜欢这个故事.我向 ta 展示了这篇文字,而 ta 笑了.刚开寒暄一下,然后说起关于 ta 在借宿学校的经历,一个小时后,ta 告诉我 ta 在新学校一直感到忧郁.然后 ta 在那里开始踢足球,这是 ta 打发大多数夜晚的东西.后来,ta 的父母把 ta 送到英国读书,住在 ta 叔叔的家庭里面和 ta 的叔叔的孩子上同一家大学.感谢的是,第一次见面不算尴尬."不好意思,因为我在学校对你做的事,我想和你交谈说清楚这些东西,我尝试在 facebook 上联系你,但我没有勇气"ta 说.那么,为什么我不自在 facebook 找 ta?我去.在回家之前,我紧紧的抱着 ta 说:"那不是你的错,A,我一直给你巧克力,不好意思呀." ta 没有迟疑也紧紧的抱着我.我喜欢 ta 头发的气味,好的洗发水,我想.昨晚在睡之前,我们谈了 2 个小时的电话.我想,我恋爱了,可能.但,ta 呢?

Edit 4- As I scrolled through the comments, I found that few of you recommend that I clear things with him. I think our childhood matter is sorted now since both of us are on the same page about it. The things left to clear are- my feelings for him and his for me. I do have feelings for him and he's single too. He had a British girl in his life but he said that they broke up in march and they haven't talked since then. But come to think of it, I really don't know if he has feelings the way I have for him. And I don't want to rush into anything right now because that would be childish. To be frank, I want to enjoy his company and roam around with him and know him more as a person and not just the events that have happened in his life. I want to know what he likes, what makes him angry and what makes him blush and stuff. By the way, I do have an interesting plan for tomorrow. I'll keep you all updated. And I hope he's not following this post because I've been expressing a lot here. But if he is, then A, why don't you express what you feel about me stupid?

> 更新 4-当我翻阅这些评论的时候,我发现你们一些人建议我和 ta 说清楚.从我们处于同一个场景的时候,我想我们的童年时的情结现在理清了.剩下需要说清楚的是-我对 ta 的感情和 ta 对我的感情.我的确对他有感觉,而 ta 现在又是单身.ta 之前有一个英国的女朋友,但 ta 们在 3 月份就分开了,从那时起甚至再也没交谈过.但想想这个,我真的不知道 ta 是否像我喜欢 ta 一样喜欢我.我不想现在太过仓促的去做某些事,因为这太孩子气了.老实说,我喜欢有 ta 的陪伴和漫步在 ta 身边,和更了解 ta 个人而不是仅仅发生在 ta 人生中的某些事件.我想知道哪些是 ta 喜欢的,哪些让 ta 生气,哪些让 ta 脸红或者感到充实.随便一体,我对明天有一个有趣的计划.我会给你们更新的.我希望 ta 没有看见这篇文字,因为我在这里流露了太多东西.如果 ta 看见了,A,为什么你还不表达你对我的愚笨有什么感觉?

Edit 5- 07/11- I don't usually jog because I go to a dance class twice a week and have been blessed with good metabolism. But this morning, I made an exception. A's relative's place is where he will be staying for 27 more days and that place was about 15 minutes run from my home. So, I called him and asked if he'd like to run with me. "Sure, why not? What time?" "Right now. I'm outside your place." 8 minutes later, he was running with me. I removed my headphones and he put it in his pocket. We mostly talked about the places and shops and other landmarks that came on our way. He asked me if I run daily. "I do. Thrice or four times a week," I smiled, "Do you want to join me?" "Yes, if you don't mind," he said. "I'll think about it," I liked the little attention. Once while running, he pushed me with his arm, not hard enough to make me fall though."Oh, c'mon, what are you a kid?" I said angrily. He laughed and then I pushed him too. "Remember, I used to do this in the school too sometimes," he said.

> 更新 5 -11 月 07 日-我不经常跑步,因为我每周去练舞 2 次还出奇的身体健康.今天早上,我觉得要意外一下.A 要在 ta 亲戚处待 27 天,而那地方离我这里仅仅只有 15 分钟.所以,我打电话给 ta.问 ta 是否愿意和我一起跑跑步."好呀,为什么不呢?什么时间?""现在,我在你住的地方外面."8 分钟后,ta 和我一起跑步.我把我的耳机摘掉,ta 把它放到 ta 的口袋里面.我们大多数说着沿路的商店和其他标志性建筑.ta 问我是不是日常都跑步,"是的,一个星期 3 次到 4 次,"我笑着说,"你想和我一起跑步吗?" "好呀,只要你不介意的话"ta 说."我会想一下我会不会介意的",我喜欢这种小小的套路.在一次跑步中,ta 用手臂推了我一下,虽然力气不足于的让我摔倒,"oh,窝草,你还是小屁孩吗?"我生气的说.ta 笑了,然后我推回 ta."还记得吗,我在学校也经常做这个,"ta 说

Edit 6- 15/11- We hangout more often now. I went shopping with him and helped him select for the wedding functions. He asked me to come to the wedding but I said that it would be very awkward as his parents and relatives will be there and they’d think ugh… maybe they’d think…. I don’t know because there’s a lot on my mind about that. Like what it will be like when I meet his parents. The first thing that they’ll think is that they had to leave the town because of me. I even imagined how it would be like if we get married and how will the relation be like between me and my mother-in-law. But I think I went too far with that thought. Also, last night while texting, even though the discussion started with awkwardness, we talked about our kissing episodes and how dumb we were! Like it was an almost three hour discussion and it ended with him saying ‘what if we did that today.’ And I said, ‘Not so soon darling’ followed by a wink emoji.

> 更新 6 -11 月 15 日-我们现在更多时间聚在一起了.我和 ta 一起去购物,帮 ta 选购婚礼上用的东西.ta 邀请我去参加婚礼.但我说这会很尴尬,因为 ta 父母和亲戚都在场,他们或许会胡思乱想.我不知道,因为当时很多东西在我的思绪里面.比如我遇到 ta 的父母会怎样.第一件事就是我是 ta 们离开这个地方的原因.我甚至想象在我们结婚后会怎么,我和 ta 妈妈之间的婆媳关系会怎样.我想我在这方面走得太远了.昨晚发信息的时候,即使开头很尴尬,我们开始说起我们在学校里面的接吻情节和我们当时有多笨.这次交谈差不多 3 个小时,结束在"如果我们现在接吻呢",而我说,"再等一等,亲"带着一个眨眼的表情.

ps- omg!!! there were so many comments. i checked this page today after like a week and so many comments. i literally had tears while reading. i promise i will keep this updated. and some of you said that it’s possible that he might also be reading this post. idk maybe or maybe not. he had not mentioned about this to me. so i guess he’s not following. and some of you suggested i give him a chocolate again. nice idea peeps. i will when i’m ready. gives me a little goosebumps when i think of giving him a chocolate now. but i will mostly before he departs.

> ps-窝草!!!太多的留言了.我在一周后查看这些浏览,但太多留言了.我几乎流着泪看完这些留言.我保证我会持续更新的.你们之中的一些人说可能 ta 也看到这篇文字.是也不是.ta 没向我提起过这些东西.所以我想 ta 没有看见.你们之间的一些人提议我再给 ta 一块巧克力,很好的主意.当我准备好的时候,我会的.现在想给 ta 一块巧克力,足够让我起鸡皮疙瘩了.在 ta 差不多离开这里之前,我会给的.

Edit 7- This happened like just an hour ago. He gifted me a gold chain. He had two of these which his grandmother left for him and he gave one of the pair to me. I tried very hard to reject it but in the end, he was like “I want you to have it. So you'll always remember that you're precious to me.” He put it around my neck. It was so so so so so awkward but I felt good and it was like something was melting inside me. I told him “Look, don't take decisions in such a rush. You may find someone better for this. Maybe I don't deserve it.” “You do,” is all he said after that. I don't know. I kind of feel like.. I don't know… This feeling is new to me. I have never been of such importance to someone. And then he kept his hand on my cheek and rubbed his thumb softly around. God, this is definitely new to me. I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight. Perhaps if he was here.

> 更新 7 - 这个是差不多一个小时前发生的.ta 给我一条金链.ta 有两条这样的链子,因为这是 ta 奶奶留给 ta 的,而 ta 把其中的一条给了我.我很努力的去拒绝,但最后,ta 说"我希望你拥有它,那么你就会一直记得你对我是多么的珍贵."ta 把它戴到我的颈上.这真的尴尬 5 次方,但我感觉很好,而且有一些东西在我内心慢慢融化.我告诉 ta"嗯,不要这么仓促的就决定了,你可能能找到更好的.或许我根本不值得拥有它."你值得,"在我说出那些后,ta 只说了这一句.我不知道,我感觉有点像...我不知道,对于我这是一种新的感觉.我从来没有对其他人那么重要过.然后 ta 把手放在我脸上,温柔的抚摸着我的脸颊.我不知道我今晚可不可以睡着.可能是因为 ta 在这里(2017 年 11 月 16 日,23:51)

Edit 8- 17/11- Yash Sahu, I did notice your comment and I read each and every comment because I scroll through the comments at least once a day. First I used to do it on my cell but now I use my laptop because I don't want to miss any. Thank you for your love, darling! Now coming to Mr. Charming, I asked him what his plans were for the future. He said that he would like me to go to US with him for post graduation. I mean, that does tell that he is serious about me. So, I will complete my graduation in 2019 and then maybe or maybe not, I'll head with him. Around two years I'll get to be with him and probably stay in the same apartment but I'm not sure about anything about this now. I'll have to talk to mom and dad and I'll even have to tell them that he will be with me all the time. Also, I have to tell them about the gold chain which I have currently I have been hiding in my…(I cannot tell you where I'm hiding it haha). I spoke to my bestie about this my morning. She basically wants me to go ahead with A because she finds him attractive(that's okay because either find her boyfriend hot too). But I don't want to rush with this but I don't want to take too much time either. To be frank, I did have a plan to go for higher studies abroad and if he's with me, that's a bonus, right? I told him “I'll think about it?” “What kind of a response can I expect?” he asked. “Not a bad one.” I said. I do want to go to him and I have realized now that I am in love with him but I don't know how to express that to him. Maybe a chocolate? Also, he has not said the three words till now. But these hints he gives are I think enough to tell that he probably does love me, no?

> 更新 8-11 月 17 月 -yeah,我的确看你们的留言而且我看了每一条留言,因为我往下翻滚了一天.刚开始我在手机上看见,现在我必须要用电脑了,因为我不想错过任何一条.谢谢你们的喜爱,亲.现在 ta 是 Mr.charming 了,我问 ta 关于未来的计划.ta 希望我在毕业之后跟 ta 去英国.我想,这意味着 ta 开始认真考虑我们了.我将在 2019 年完成学业,然后我可能会去英国可能不会,这取决于 ta.在两年内,我会去和 ta 一起,或许是同居在一起,但我现在还不确定.我必须去告诉我妈,我爸,ta 在以后一直会陪在我身边.同时,我还得告诉他们我现在的那条金链,被我藏在我的...(不能告诉你,我藏在哪里了 haha).我在今早和我的闺蜜谈起,她基本想我去和 A 在一起,因为她发现 A 很吸引人(这很正常,因为我也觉得她的男票很 sexy).我不想太过仓促的做出决定也不想花费太多的时间来考虑.老实说,我有一个计划和 ta 在一起在国外完成高等教育,这是一个奖赏,对吧?我告诉 ta,"我会考虑这个的","我能期待得到什么样的结果?"ta 问."不会是坏的结果."我说.我的确想和 ta 在一起,但我必须考虑到我喜欢 ta,但我不知道怎么向 ta 表达出来.或许一块巧克力?而且,ta 还没对我说那三个字.但 ta 给出的一些提示足够去证明 ta 爱我,难道不是吗?

I got 94% in class 12, science group. Now I'm doing CA, nowhere related to science, even 60% in 12th would have sufficed.

> 我在 12 年级得到 94 分,科学小组什么的.现在我在 CA,和科学一点关系都没,即使在 12 年级拿 60 分也可以做的.

My sister got 65% in class 10. While everybody was busy bashing her, she scored 94% in class 12 and people called it luck (WTH!?!?!)

> 我妹在 10 年级拿到 65 分,那时每个人都忙着批斗她.当她在 12 年级拿到 94 的,而其他人说这是踩狗屎(窝草)

My cousin got 75% in class 12. Went on to do B.Sc in computer science. Later went on to become a gold medalist in MBA, now working for an MNC with a jaw dropping package.

> 我的表弟在 12 级得 75 分.去 B.Sc 读计算机.然后在 MBA 的时候成为金牌得主,现在为一家跨国公司工作.

My friend scored decent marks in class 12, had the means to fly abroad for higher education, now owns a house in that country.

> 我的朋友在 12 年级只得到了一个得体的分数,ta 在国外留学,现在在那个国家都有一套房子了.

And here in my country, parents and students fail to understand that grades have nothing to do with success, and the students pay their lives as the ultimate price…

> 在我们的国家里面,父辈和学生都很难明白成绩和成功是不挂钩的,而学生要为此付出惨重的代价.

Education is important, no doubt. But the marks, I doubt. Scores don't define you, scores don't decide your life.

My wife is emotionally unstable and mentally unwell. One night before bed, she was having one of her breakdowns, saying all kind of terrible things, stressing me out like crazy. My grade-school daughter was in her room down the hall, and I made sure to keep both bedroom doors closed, to prevent her from hearing what was going on in our bedroom.

> 我妻子的情绪和精神都不太稳定.一晚,在睡之前,她正在经历心情低沉,说了很多恐怖的东西,都快把我逼疯了.我正在上小学的女儿在厅下面的房间里面,我确保两边的房门都关紧了,预防她听见我们房间里面正在发生的事.

All I could do when my wife was having an episode like this was to hug her and try to calm her by saying “I’m sorry you’re hurting - I will always love you, no matter what” - not much more I could do, as she couldn’t be reasoned with when she was having one of her episodes.

> 当我妻子遭遇这种情况的时候,我所能做的只有努力说着"我很心疼你正在饱受伤害,我一直爱着你呀,不论怎么样"去使她平静下来.-其他我什么也做不了,当她在经历这些不讲道理的时候.

Then I’d rush over to my daughter’s room and talk with her about fun stuff and joke around with her as if everything was OK, to calm and comfort her, and make her feel that there was nothing to worry about. Then I’d rush back to my wife to try deal with her drama, then back again, trying to meet the needs of both my wife and my daughter.

> 然后我会走进我女儿的房间,和她聊一些有趣的事情和笑话,让她觉得一切事都还正常,去安慰她,让她安心不为其他事担心.然后我又会跑到我妻子那里来应对她的闹剧,然后反复,尝试在我女儿和妻子需要我的时候,我能在她们身边.

I figured that my daughter could hear something was wrong, but she didn’t mention it, until once she said to me, “Dad, thank you for dealing with mommy so I don’t have to - you’re a good man.”

> 我发现我的女儿她能够发现一些事变坏了,但她没有提起,直到有一次她和我说,"papa,谢谢你一直照料 mom,那我就不必(看见 mom 不好的一面)-你是一个好 papa."

That was over ten years ago, but I still tear up even now, writing about it.

## 人能教育过度吗?

Yes. Going anonymous because I'm going to talk about my father.

> 是的.匿名是为了谈一下我的父亲.

My father is extremely intelligent. At school he used to score straight A’s all the time. He was constantly learning about all the subjects. He studied all the time. He then graduated from medical school fairly easily and studied histology (how cells are made basically), and then became a psychiatrist.

> 我父亲是超级聪明的人.在学校里面,ta 都习惯一直拿 A 了.ta 不断的学习所有的科目.ta 所有时间都在学习.然后 ta 轻易的从医学院毕业,然后开始学组织学(细胞的基本构建),然后成为一个精神病医生.

When I was a kid, I used to ask him a lot of questions, and whether it was about biology, history, or complicated or rarely used words, he just knew the answer.

> 在我还是小屁孩的时候,我经常向 ta 提问很多的问题,无论那个问题是生物,历史或者是复杂几乎很少用的词汇,ta 统统都知道.

But here's the thing: he was extremely lonely. He didn't really care about social interaction. All he cared about was absorbing a big quantity of information. He can't even really share it with other people since he doesn't have any friends. All this information he accumulated during all those years will just be kept to himself. That is overeducation.

> 但有一个问题就是:ta 非常孤独.ta 不怎么在乎社交互动,ta 在一的是专心于大量的信息里面.从 ta 没有朋友以来,ta 就没有和其他人分享过这些东西.在这些年里面 ta 一直处理的那些信息也只能保留给自己.这就是教育过度.

I love my father, and now that I am an adult we have a good relationship (when I was a kid we didn't talk at all). But I think maybe he could have educate himself a bit less and develop his social skills a bit more…

> 我爱我的父亲,现在我成年了,我们之间的关系良好(在我还是小孩的时候,我们不怎么交谈).但我想或许 ta 应该让自己受的教育少一点,然后增加 ta 一点点的社交技巧.

“Alright….what do you do for a living?”

> "了解...你现在在做什么工作呀?"

—I work at a makeup store. My BOYFRIEND works in software development.

> 我在一个化妆店上班.我男票是程序猿.(程序猿果然是万能的)

“Nice, nice. How do you know (birthday boy) Shane?”

> "哇,这么好,你是怎么认识(生日的主角)Shane 的?"

—We had a class together freshman year of college. Two years before I met my BOYFRIEND.

My parents divorced when I was 7 years old. I grew up and spent time mostly with my mom and stepdad. I always thought my dad had simply abandoned me and my sister to start a new family with my stepmom.

> 我的父母在我 7 岁的时候离婚了.我几乎大部分时间都是和我妈和继父度过的.我一直想是我爸抛弃了我和我妹妹,然后和后母组建新的家庭.

In my early 20s I had drinks with my dad, and the biggest plot twist of my life was revealed. My mom had actually cheated on my dad for a year. My dad knew about it the whole time. But, he still loved my mom and he wanted to keep the marriage together, especially for me and my sister.

> 在我 20 岁的时候,我和我爸一起喝酒,然后人生那个最大的转折才浮现出来.我妈给我爸绿帽整整一年,而我爸一直知道这件事.但我爸还是爱着我妈,为了我和我妹还想保持一个完整的婚姻.

Eventually they divorced. My dad was heartbroken and alone in his suffering. Then he met my stepmom. She offered him a shoulder to cry on. But, she wanted to start a family. So she gave him an ultimatum: ‘Either I’ll leave you now, or you come start a family with me.’ He chose the latter. Can I really blame him?

> 最终 ta 们离婚了.我爸独自一人承受着心碎和孤独.然后 ta 遇见了后母.后母她给他提供了可以给他哭泣的肩膀.但她希望成立一个家庭.所以她给了他最后通牒:'是我现在离开你,还是你和我组建一个家庭.'他选择了后者.我真的能责怪他吗?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming response.

> 更新: 谢谢你们的留言

I love my mother. She is the best mother I could ever wish for. She did what she thought was best for us. I’m not angry with her. I don’t blame her.

> 我爱我妈.她是我许愿想得到的那种好的母亲.她做了她觉得对我们最好的选择.我对她不生气,也不责怪她.

I love my father. I understand why he chose to be with my stepmom. It makes sense. He didn’t completely abandon us. He was there. We just didn’t see him much. But, I know he loves us. He shows that in his own way.

> 我爱我爸.我明白他为什么选择和我后母在一起.这是说得过去的.他没抛弃我们.他一直在那里.只是我们不常见到他.但我知道他爱我们.他按照他的方式展示了出来.

As for the ultimatum. Giving a life-changing ultimatum to a person who is completely broken is dubious. A heartbroken person who has hit rock bottom is not able to think rationally. To me, it seems exploitative.

> 对于那个通牒.把改变生活的通牒给一个完全崩溃的,毫无把握的人.一个踢到生活底部不能理性去思考的人.对于我来说,这看来就是不地道.(shit,我不想出声)

The message I hoped to convey is that mothers and fathers always try to do what they think is the best for their children. They are people just like you and me. They have flaws. They are irrational at times. They make mistakes. No one has the right answer to any given situation. We are all kind of stumbling our way through life trying to make the best decisions. But sometimes, those decisions can have negative implications. They can hurt people you love. So you try to make amends.

> 这条消息我希望传达的是父母总是为他们的孩子.他们也是像你和我一样的人.他们有缺点,在某些时间不讲道理,他们犯错.没有人有应对生活给出所有情况的答案.我们在生活的磕磕绊绊里总是想去做出最好的决定.但某些时候,这些决定有着负类影响.那些决定伤害了你爱的人.所以,你想去做一些弥补.

If you accept that your parents are not perfect. That they have flaws. That they are clueless at times. But, that they always try to do what they think is the best for you. Then learn to forgive them.

> 如果你接受你的父母不是完美的,ta 们有 ta 们自己的缺点.在那会他们很愚蠢.但,他们一直在努力去对有利于你的选择(都是为了你好?).然后,学着去原谅他们.

Maybe, one day, you’ll wish your children would forgive you too.

> 或者,一天,你会希望你的孩子会原谅你.
