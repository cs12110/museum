## 最好的复仇

From:&nbsp; [What was the best revenge you've ever gotten?](http://qr.ae/TUGGcK)

Date: September 26 2018

It wasn’t me, but a college buddy. But it was so sweet, I have to share.

> 不是我,是我大学里面的一个老铁.但这复仇太甜了(怀疑是狗粮,认真脸),我必须要分享出来.

There was a really beautiful, popular girl my friend, call him Mike, had a serious crush on. He asked her out several times but she was always “busy”. She never really discouraged him though, I think she liked the attention.

> 有一个很漂亮且很受人待见的女孩子,我的老铁,就叫他 Mike 吧,超级喜欢她的.他想约她出去很多次了,但那个女孩子的回复一直是"忙,不约,不约".
> 她从来没有明确的拒绝他,我想她是喜欢获取他的注意吧(备胎 Queue).

One day Mike got ahold of two tickets to a sold out U2 concert. He bought them from a friend who had to go out of town for an emergency.

> 有一天,Mike 拿着两张 U2 的演唱会门票.他从一个临时有急事出外的朋友那里买的.

Mike immediately called the girl of his dreams and of course she accepted. He was thrilled and everything seemed fine.

> Mike 立即打电话给那个他梦里的女孩子,当然那个女孩子接受了.他当然很激动啦,而且所有的事情看起来都往好的方面发展了.(莱纳德的孩子).

The night of the concert they’re at the arena waiting for the show to begin and she suddenly says, “Oh, I see my friend, I’ll be right back!”

> 在演唱会的那晚,他们在舞台前等待着演唱会开始,然后那个女孩子说,"窝草,我看到我的朋友了,我一会再回来!"

You guessed it, she never returned. Mike stayed at the seats since that’s the only place she would logically look for him. When the show ended, Mike ever the gentleman, waited for a long time so he could drive her home. But saw no sign of her. She didn’t answer her phone or texts. So he left feeling so hurt.

> 你猜发生了什么,她根本没再回来.Mike 坐在那里

By the next morning he was rightfully pissed! She called him around noon apologizing and saying she ran into her ex they had a long talk and worked out a lot of stuff and lost track of time. She had actually missed the concert and blah, blah, blah.

> 第二天早上,他正在恼怒的时候.那个女孩子打电话来了,没有一句道歉,然后告诉他,她看见了她的前男友,然后双方展开了一次深刻的对话,解决了很多历史遗留问题以及在人海中重逢.她真的很想念这场音乐会,bla,bla,bla...

He accepted her apology and asked if they could try again. She accepted and told him how very nice and forgiving he was. She had underestimated him!

> 他接受了她的道歉,然后邀请她在出去一次.她接受了,然后给他发好人卡和告诉他是个绝世好男人.但她低估他了.

So the next Saturday evening he took her to a very expensive seafood restaurant about an hour up the coast. He was polite and chatty the whole way up there. He made the reservation in her name.

> 所以第二个星期六晚上,他带她去一个离海边不远的很贵的海鲜餐厅.他很礼貌而且说了很多话,在一路上.他用了她的名字来订餐.

They were seated, ordered a nice bottle of wine, some expensive appetizers and entrees, then Mike excused himself to go to the men’s room. He very deliberately said, “I’ll be right back.”

> 他们入座,点了上好的红酒啦,一些很贵的小菜和主餐,然后 Mike 说他要去厕所啦,他甚至故意的说,"我一会回来."

He walked out to the parking lot and drove away. And became the hero of every good guy who’s been treated like crap by a girl because she just didn’t give a damn about his feelings.

> 他走到停车场,然后回去了.然后成为每一个曾经被那些女孩子当做垃圾对待的备胎的榜样,因为她根本没在乎他的感觉.

I still love that story!!

> 我超喜欢这个故事的.

## 生涯最尬时刻

From:&nbsp; [What is your most embarrassing moment at school?](http://qr.ae/TUGt9E)

Date: September 27 2018

Not mine, but a girl that went to my school.

> 不是我,是一个转来我们学校的女孩子.

One day, out of the blue, this one girl started getting a bigger and bigger stomach. The students noticed pretty quickly, and so did the teachers.

> 那一天,在外边,那个女孩子开始了一阵又一阵的胃痛.那些同学和老师很快意识到她不舒服.

This girl wasn’t exactly a model student. She was pretty well known for partying and drinking and messing around with a lot of different guys.

> 那个女孩子不是颜值逆天的那种学生.众所周知,她喜欢聚会啦,喝酒啦,然后和一堆男的混在一起.

So everyone, including the teachers, realized that she was pregnant.

> 所以每一个人,包括老师,都知道她怀孕了.

She didn’t do a very good job hiding it, and pretty much everyone in the school knew about it. Whenever she walked into the room, there were a lot of whispers among the students. Even the teachers gossiped about her.

> 她没能太好的隐藏这个迹象,所以每一个在学校里面的人都知道了这个消息.不论何时她走进教室里面,学生都在那里议论纷纷.甚至那些老师都有点八卦了.

Eventually, the counselors caught wind of it. They brought in a teenage pregnancy specialist and called the girl in to talk.

> 最后,辅导主任闻到了风.他们带来了早孕的专家然后叫那个女孩子来询问情况.

Imagine their surprise, when they asked the girl what she was planning to do with the baby, and she responded “What baby?”

> 想象一下他们吃惊的表情,当他们问到那个女孩子有什么关于小屁孩的计划的时候,然后那个女孩子说"什么孩子?" 我没有,不知道,别瞎说.jpg

It turns out the girl wasn’t pregnant, she was just really fat.

> 发现那个女孩子并没有怀孕,而仅仅是因为她比较胖而已.

She recently had a messy breakup with her boyfriend and had stopped caring about her health. She used food to deal with her emotions.

> 她最近和她男朋友闹分手,然后对自己的健康一点也不注意.她把悲愤化作力量消灭食物.

Long story short, her stomach was filled with Doritos, not a baby.

> 长话短说,她的胃全是薯片,而不是小屁孩.

The school was extremely embarrassed and tried to cover it up, but completely failed. The entire student body found out.

> 学校觉得很丢脸了,然后尝试去掩盖这件事,但绝壁失败了.整个学校都知道了整件事.

The next year, she transferred schools.

> 第二年,她转校了.

I can’t really blame her.

> 我不能怪她,哈,哈,哈.

## 人生最难放弃的是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What's the hardest thing to give up in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGvU1)

Date: September 28 2018

I have a friend who says her boyfriend has stopped loving her. She tells me every boyfriend she has ever had has stopped loving her. She assures me there is something wrong with her.

> 我有一个朋友说她的男朋友不在喜欢她了.她告诉我她之前的每一个男朋友到最后都不喜欢她了.她像我确认是不是她做错了什么.

Her boyfriend is a friend of mine. His mom died a few months ago and he is mourning.

> 她的男朋友也是我的一个朋友.他的老妈在几个月前去世了,而他现在都还没走出悲伤中去.

What he tells me is that he loves this woman, but that the grief he is managing is too big and is crowding out everything else.

> 他告诉我他还喜欢那个那孩子,但是他要办一个葬礼的太重要,以至于掩盖了生活中的其他事物.

Her insecurity and her insistence that he does not love her is proving too much for him to handle.

> 她的不安和强调他不再喜欢她了,正好说好他现在手上的事情太多了.

I really want to mind my own business but I do try to tell my friend that what her boyfriend is going through has nothing to do with her or his love for her.

> 我很想只管我自己的屁事,但我想去告诉我的朋友,她男朋友现在需要经历的东西和她一点关系也没有,或者告诉她,他还喜欢她.

She shakes her head. She does not want to hear me.

> 她摇了摇头.然后不再想听我说了.

The hardest thing to give up is the thing we have decided to believe.

> 生命里,最难放弃的应该我们曾坚信的东西吧.

## 来呀,相互变好呀.

From:&nbsp; [How can we make the world a better place?](http://qr.ae/TUGyrh)

Date: September 29 2018

Last month, right after we graduated from Yale, my boyfriend and I spent two weeks working on a small organic farm in France.

> 上个月,在我们刚才耶鲁毕业不久,我男票和我花了两周时间在法国弄了一个很小的有机农场.

The owner of our farm turned out to be a tall, wiry man named Emmanuel, with a gruff smile and an easy laugh. He spoke French with his wife and kids, but he’d explain our work to us in English, occasionally pausing in the middle of a word to remember the proper pronunciation.

> 发现那个农场的主人是一个很高大的,嗓音很小的叫 Emmanuel 的男人,带着笑得花枝乱颤,而且还很喜欢笑.他和他的妻儿说法语,但他向我们介绍我们的工作的时候是用英语的.在偶尔,断断续续的说一句话,因为要找到合适的英语单词.

One time, he took us to the greenhouse and showed us spots of brown mold that had begun creeping over the leaves on the tomato plants. “Ze tomatoes get sick sometimes,” he said. “It’s a big…how do you say…a big pr…”

> 有一次,他带我们去温室,然后给我们看了一小块地方,那里都有霉菌在土豆的叶子上繁殖了."这些土豆有时候会生病,"他说."这是一个大的...你们怎么说的,一个很大的..."

A problem? I suggested in my mind, assuming that was the word he was looking for.

> 一个问题?我内心 os 如是,假设这个词是他想说的.

But then Emmanuel smiled and said, “Ah, project. It’s a big project.”

> 但是 Emmanuel 笑着说,"嗯,project,一个很大的项目."

With that, he gave us clippers and buckets, and showed us how to clip off certain leaves from infected tomato plants to prevent the mold from spreading.

> 在那,他把钳子和篮子给我们了,然后教我们怎么从土豆上把感染的枝叶剪下来,防止那些霉菌扩散.

Where I saw a problem, Emmanuel saw a project. This attitude was one he carried with him everywhere, no matter how big the problem or how difficult the solution. He worked from dawn to dusk - often heavy, backbreaking work - fixing the things that other people saw as problems.

> 当我想说是一个问题的时候,Emmanuel 却看见了一个工程.这就是他一直以来的态度了,不论多大的问题和多难的境地.他从早到晚,经常锄禾日当午,修复别人眼里面视为问题的东西.

On my last day working for him, I asked Emmanuel why he decided to become a farmer, and he just shook his head and said, “Ah, zere are lots of people in the world these days, and zat makes a lot of hunger. It’s a big project.”

> 在我最后一天在那工作的时候,我问 Emmanuel 为什么他决定成为一个农夫的,然后他摇了摇头说,"嗯,这世界很多的人在外边,他们制造了饥饿.这是一个很大的工程."

It’s a simple thing, just a casual switch of words - but at the same time, it’s kind of profound.

> 这是一件很简单的事,仅仅是转换一个概念,但是同时意义深远.

Want to make the world a better place? Learn to turn problems into projects. It’s a simple way to start.

> 想改变世界?学会把问题变成工程呀.这是一个简单的开头了.

## 说过最蠢的话?

From:&nbsp; [What is the dumbest thing you have ever said in your life?](http://qr.ae/TUGb02)

Date: October 09 2018

I threw a piece of trash on the floor, and my friend told me to pick it up, and I said:

> 我随手扔垃圾之后,一个朋友叫我捡起来,然后我说:

“I'm doing someone a favor by not picking this up. If I pick it up, the janitor won't have a job.”

> "我不捡起来是做好事好吧.如果捡起来,清洁工就没有工作了."

I genuinely believed that if I picked up my trash, the demand for janitors would decrease. I was a stupid fucking kid.

> 我之前相信如果我捡起垃圾的话,那些清洁工就会被裁员.我那时还是一个没脑的孩子呀.

Little did I know that the janitor would have his job no matter what, and I was just being a complete dick by making it harder for him.

> 在之后我才知道,清洁工无论怎样都会有工作的,而我白白变成了一个混蛋,还给 ta 们添麻烦了.

Pick up your trash people. Don't be a dumbass like I was (am).

> 捡起你的东西,垃圾.别像我一样.

## 能孤独终老吗?

From:&nbsp; [Do we need friends in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGO0k)

Date: October 10 2018

This is Isaac Newton.

> 来,来,来,这个就是牛顿了.

He was… an asshole.

> ta 是一个操蛋的人.

And a loner.

> 同时也是一个孤独的人.

He had no wife, no girlfriends, several dozen enemies and a non-existent social life.

> ta 没有老婆啦,没有女朋友啦,还有一吨的反对者和一个没有社交的生活.

He had just ONE friend his entire life.

> ta 在生命里面,只有一个朋友.

In college, he found a guy named John Wickins.

> 在大学的时候,ta 认识了一个叫 John Wickins 的人.

Their friendship sparked when both of them bumped into each other while taking walks. It turned out, both were fed up with their loudmouth roommates, so they decided to move in together.

> ta 们之间友谊的火花在 ta 们相处间迸发.发现,ta 们两个都受够了各自叽叽喳喳的室友,所以 ta 们决定住在一起算了.

Over the years, they studied together and despite Isaac’s weirdness, Wickins put up with him. He became a caring figure, always making sure Newton ate and slept properly.

> 些许年过去了,ta 们在一起学习啦,憎恨 Iassc 的命运了,Wickins 也忍受下来了.ta 成为了一个会照顾人的人,一直确保牛顿不会饿肚子和睡得安稳一点.

Their discussions largely revolved around academia - a common interest. And Wickins found himself helping Newton with his crazy experiments from time to time.

> 他们的讨论主要围绕着学术界 - 一个共同的兴趣,Wickins 发现自己一直以来经常帮助牛顿做他的疯狂实验.

But it wasn’t to last.

> 但这些都没能走到最后.

There’s speculation that Newton and Wickins had a major falling out years later, and it’s not an unfounded suspicion.

> 有一种推测就是牛顿和 Wickins 在一些年后大吵了一架,这不是毫无根据的猜测.

Newton was cold, callous, rude and generally didn’t have much time for people until he needed them.

> 牛顿是一个冷漠的,无情的,粗鲁的而且平常除了需要被人否则老死不相往来的人.

After Wickins left, he never spoke of Newton again. It’s a bit strange since most people would’ve liked to say they’ve known a famous/influential guy.

> 在 Wickins 离开之后,ta 从没提起过牛顿.这有点奇怪,因为大部分的人都喜欢结交有名的人.

But there’s nothing. He didn’t even mention he knew Newton to his own son.

> 但 ta 什么也没提起,就连自己的儿子也没曾透露.

After he left, Newton realized just how much work Wickins had selflessly been doing for his laboratory.

> 在 ta 离开后,牛顿意识到 Wickins 为 ta 的实验室做了多少的牺牲.

Still, all he did was find a new assistant.

> 但 ta 所做的,仅仅是招了一个新的实验助手.

And that was the end of the friendship.

> 这就是 ta 们友谊的尽头了.

The only one he ever had.

> ta 唯一的一段友谊.

Some people aren’t cut out for friends.

> 有一些人脱离人群.

They can’t stand other people and other people can’t stand them.

> ta 们不能忍受和其他人待在一起,其他人也不能忍受 ta.

They should just lock themselves in rooms and make themselves useful.

> ta 们就把自己所在屋子里面,做着自己的事情.

It’s best for everyone.

> 这对每一个人都好呀.

Newton didn’t exactly have an easy or a fun life. It was riddled with hardship, tragedy, loss and little joy.

> 牛顿没有一个轻松愉悦的生活.到处都是撞壁,悲剧,迷失和仅有的一点快乐.

But he did end up famous.

> 但 ta 的确出名了.

And, as the eternal debate between enjoying life in the present moment versus working to have an eternal impact on Earth rages on, we must think for ourselves.

> 而且,在活在当下享受生活,还是造福地球这种争论下,我们需要结合自身来考虑.

What life do we want?

> 我们想要什么样的生活?

You don’t “need” friends.

> 你不必需要朋友.

They’re not essential like air or water. But they do have benefits and drawbacks, like most things.

> ta 们不是想水和空气一样的生活基础物质.但 ta 们都有着各自的缺点和有点,就像其他的东西一样.

You choose the life you want to lead.

> 你选择你要的生活.

I’ve chosen mine.

> 我选择我的.

## 成功的最基础技巧是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What is the most fundamental skill for success in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGWd1)

Date: October 11 2018

A renowned author once visited Yale to speak at an event for young aspiring writers. At the end, she opened the floor for questions.

> 一个有名的作家有一次来到 Yela 演讲,为了激励那些年轻的作家.在最后,ta 公开提问的环节.

One student, hoping to learn how to write a bestseller, asked, “What’s the trick to becoming a successful writer?”

> 一个学生,希望知道怎样才能写出大卖的书,问道,"成为成功的作家有哪些方法没?"

The author replied, “The application of the ass to the chair.”

> 那个作者回答说,"一个关于 ass 和 chair 的史书呀."

If you want to succeed in life, one of the most fundamental skills you’ll need is the discipline to make yourself sit down and work for it.

> 如果你想要一个成功的人生,最基础的技巧就是你需要坐下来,并开始为之努力.

## 为人父母,你不应该对小屁孩说什么?

From:&nbsp; [As a parent, what should you never say to a teenager?](http://qr.ae/TUGifT)

Date: October 12 2018

Mom: You can tell me anything. I promise I won't scold you or judge you, I promise.

> Mom:你可是告诉我全部东西呀.我保证我不会骂你和评判你的,我绝壁保证.

Kid: “Umm. I'm a little gay, I think. I flunked my recent English test. Also, umm-”

> kid:"好吧,我是 gay 呀.我把英语考试弄砸了.同时,还有-"

Mom: _a little stoicly_ “Go on.”

> Mom: (忍了一下) "继续往下说"

Kid: “A little sad. Yeah.”

> Kid:"有点小悲伤呀.大概就是这样子"

Mom: _takes a deeeeeeeep breath_ “Listen, honey. It's just a phase. No. You aren't gay. You are a girl. You can't like girls. It's a sin! And how could you fail your English test?! I'm so disappointed in you. You're grounded till you raise your grade. SNAP OUT OF IT!”

> Mom:(深吸一口气)"听着,小屁孩.这些都是青春期而已.不会的,你不是 gay.你是女孩子呀,你不能喜欢女孩子.这是罪来的.然后你 tmd 怎么会把英语考试弄砸?我对你很失望.你被禁足到你考过为止.重新振作起来."

Do you know what a parent should never do or say?

> 你知道作为一个父母最不应该说什么吗?

Make empty promises to their kid. You know, I was once in the shoes of the kid I was talking about. My mom promised that she would never judge me, so I told her the truth. The fact that I'm not straight (and possibly never will be one), the fact that I'm struggling with year 3 and I barely passed my first half with a class position of 21/41 (I was usually top 15 in my lower years, so getting a 21 really hit me hard).

> 对 ta 们的小屁孩承诺.你知道的,我曾经历上面说到的那个小屁孩的那种情况.我妈承诺不会评判我的,所以我告诉她真相.事实上我是弯的(而且可能孤独终老),我挣扎在年级三里面,而且我差点就跪在 21/41 的考试上了(在低年级的时候,通常我是 top15,所以在 21 的时候,这对我的打击很大)

She lied.

> ta 骗我.

I got screamed at for almost an hour before she stormed out of my room and slammed the door in my face.

> 我在她摔门而出之前,我被怒吼了差不多一个小时.

Not to make me sound like an ungrateful brathole, but my little trust in her vanished that moment.

> 虽然这样子说有点孩子气,但是那一刻,我对 ta 的信任,丧失了.

Tl;Dr: Don't promise your kid something and not fulfil it.

> 警告: 不要向你的小屁孩承诺你做不到的东西.

Mom: How much did you get for your Algebra test?

> Mom:你在 Algebra 测试里面成绩多少?

Me: 69/80 (actual score, LMAO).

> Me: 69/80(真实的成绩)

Mom: That is... _calculates in her brain_ around 85%. _takes out her phone calculator to check score_ Ah, 86. You know your cousin from [XXX school] got 96 for his Algebra finals? And here you are, getting a pathetic 86.

> Mom: 这大概是..`先在脑里计算一下` 85%,`然后拿出手机确定一下`嗯,86.你知道阿姨的谁拿到了 96 分没?然后你只拿到了 86 分.

Me: The paper is really hard...-

> 我:那试卷太难了....

Mom: And Tommy, you know, the kid you used to call dumb?

> Mom: Tommy,你知道吧,你经常说 ta 很笨的那个小屁孩

Me: I didn't call him dumb, you did.

> 我: 我没有,我不是,别瞎说.你说人家笨而已.

Mom: Whatever, it's the same. Anyway, he got 100 for his Algebra test. What are you doing in class?!?

> Mom:哎呀,都差不多啦.ta 在 Algebra 测试里面拿了 100 分,你在学校都干了啥呀?

Me: _thinks about the times I scribbled down notes_ _also thinks about the times I fell asleep or doodled in class_ Um. I wrote notes and more notes.

> 我: `想起了那些我记下笔记,想起那些我觉得很困的场景`嗯,我记笔记呀,而且记了很多.

Mom: Then why are you getting lower than your cousin and Tommy? Are you that slow? Even your other…

> Mom: 然后你就比你表 x 和 Tommy 低了?你这么笨吗?尽管你其他...

Me: _Hopes that she'll be done talking soon_

> 我: `希望她说一会就好了`

Mom: Aunt Rachel's daughter, you know, Isabelle, got a 90 for Algebra. Is it that difficult to become one of those hardworking, smart kids? How useless can you be?

> Mom: Rachel 阿姨的女儿,你认识的吧,Isabelle 也拿到了 90 分.成为学霸真的那么难吗?你怎么那么没用?

I mean, how difficult is it for parents not to compare us with other kids? I hear this on a regular basis, yeah, close to every other single ever since my first half results were out. I know, all parents — Maybe I overstated, most parents want the best for their kid.

> 我知道,作为一个父母一定要别人家的孩子比较吗?我经常听到这些东西.自从我第一次测试的成绩出来之后,我就经常听到.我知道所有的父母-或许我有点夸大,大多数的父母都希望 ta 的孩子能得到最好的.

But comparing a kid to another kid who got a better grade isn't the way. It's even worse when you insult your kid, calling them “stupid” and “dumb.”

> 但和其他的小屁孩对比不是提高成绩的套路呀.这比羞辱小孩还恶心一点,叫 ta 们`傻逼`和`笨蛋`.

Tl;Dr: Comparing your kids to others isn't fine. Calling them names makes things worse.

> 总结: 和别家小屁孩对比是不好的事.给 ta 们外号更坏了.

I rest my case.

> 我说完了.

## 结婚后,ta 有什么改变了?

From:&nbsp; [In what ways has your spouse changed after getting married?](http://qr.ae/TUGZXe)

Date: October 13 2018

This is going to be fun. But let me tell you, its more like what I thought she was like and how she actually is…

> 这就有点意思了.搬好小板凳,这更像是我以为她是那样子的,可是她实际是....

When we first met through parents, she looked like a shy girl next door. She was smiling and feeling awkward a lot. After we got married and a little more comfortable, she walks around house naked, has 0 level of shyness.

> 我们是通过相亲时遇见的,她像一个害羞的邻家女孩.她很多时候都尴尬的笑着.在我们婚后,我们相处更舒服一点之后,她可能裸着待在房子里面,害羞级别为 0.

I thought I was getting cold feet. She was being forced. Turned out she had insisted to her parents that she wanted to get married, like literally told them in a complete sentence, ‘Dad, I want to get married. I don't have any boyfriend right now. Search a groom for me.’ I'm not even exaggerating, her parents tell this story all the time.

> 我还以为我会被打入冷宫.她被逼和我结婚.后来发现是她坚持要结婚的,就像告诉她父母这样子的话,'Dad,我要结婚.但我现在没有男朋友.你们找一个麻瓜给我吧.'我甚至一点夸大都没有,她的父母一直在说着这个故事.

I thought she didn't like talking. WRONG. She NEVER shuts up. If she does, I'll wake up. Lol, I've started to enjoy it.

> 我以为她不喜欢和人说话.我错了,她从来没停过.如果她停下来了,我会笑醒的.嗯,我会开始享受那段她不说话的时间.

She's frigid. WRONG. Once comfortable, she's a freak.

> 她很高冷的.我又错了.一旦相处熟悉了,她就会变成变态了.

She's so slow and, unhappy person. Wrong. She is hyperactive and becomes happy just about at nothing.

> 她迟钝而且一脸不开心的样子.我又错了.她可是很活跃然后偶尔为一些不存在的东西而开心.

She doesn't like me. Big time wrong. Turned out, she has liked me since day 1. She loves me.

> 她不喜欢我.又错了.后来发现,她从看见我就喜欢我了.她是爱我的.

She'll probably never fight or argue. Wrong. Loveeess to argue, though I don't like to admit it much, she's usually right about things. And people too.

> 她充不争吵.又错了.最喜欢和别人杠了,虽然我不想承认,但大部分都是她是对的.和其他人也是.

Is probably passive aggressive. Wrong. Tells me when things bother her, almost immediately.

> 可能会很被动.但我又错了.如果有什么事她看不过眼,会立马告诉我.

Is dumb. Wrong. She's really smart.

> 她很笨啦.tmd 又错了.实际上她很聪明.

She does not feel much. Wrong. All of her emotions are intense.

> 她很冷漠啦.错了.她的感情是很强烈的.

Is very serious. Wrong. Very very wrong. Can't go on a day without lame jokes. Lame jokes are lifeline to her. She knows they are lame but loves it.

> 非常严肃的啦.错了,错得一塌糊涂.如果一天没看那些冷笑话,她就过不下去.冷笑话是她的生命线.她知道那些很没脑,但是很喜欢那些冷笑话.

As for the changes, she hasn't changed much. Can motherhood be included? Anyways, it suits her well.

> 对于改变来说,她没改变太多.包括成为孩子 ta 妈吗?总的来说,她做得很好了.

She's staying at her parents place with our boy. I miss her. Its been just a day though. I guess, I'll call now.

> 她现在和孩子待在她父母那边.我想她了,都已经去了一天了.我想,我现在该打电话给她了.

## 英国首相牛逼,还是印度总理牛逼一点?

From:&nbsp; [Who is more powerful, Narendra Modi or Theresa May?](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-more-powerful-Narendra-Modi-or-Theresa-May/answers/98438280)

Date: October 15 2018

Obviously Modi. Recently a dog died near my house. Someone ran over her. My good neighbor was like “In Modi's rule even a dog is not safe". I don't think anybody in the UK would expect their PM to be accountable for a dog's death in their neighborhood. That's the effect of MODI. Apparently MODI is like god because people expect him to be omnipresent and blame him for any mishap that happens around them.

> 肯定是 Modi(印度总理).最近我邻居的狗挂掉了.有人走到 ta 那里.我那邻居说"在 Modi 定律连狗都是不安全的".我不因为英国的政府会对某个人的狗挂掉而负责.但 Modi 会影响这个.很明显 Modi 就像 CPU 一样的存在,因为人们接受 ta 的无处不在,然后为了自己身边任何一点不好的事发生而责怪 ta.

## 如何让世界变得更好?

From:&nbsp; [How can we make the world a better place?](http://qr.ae/TUGJG7)

Date: October 15 2018

“Why don’t you high five a different person every day for a month?” one of my engineers challenged me.

> "为什么不和别人击掌一个月呢?"一个工程师改变的我.

He’d always make fun of my month-long challenges. I did the ketogenic diet, worked out every day, and meditated every morning—among other things.

> ta 一定在取笑我的一个月挑战.我每天都健身啦,在早上冥思一会啦.

So I accepted.

> 所以我接受了这个挑战.

On the 1st day, I high fived my wife.
On the 2nd day, I high fived my CTO.
On the 3rd day, I high fived my neighbor.

> 第一天,我和我老婆击掌.
> 第二天,我和 CTO 击掌
> 第三条,我和邻居击掌

Things got interesting when I ran out of people I knew to high five.

> 当我走出去想和别人击掌的时候,事情开始变得有趣了起来.

I’d stop strangers in the street and say something like, “Oh man, that’s a sweet dog!” and “Hey, I’m loving that jacket!”

> 我会叫一个陌生人停下脚步,然后说一些,"wow,这个狗真甜(笑)"或者"我很喜欢你的外套呀!"

I felt vulnerable putting my hand up and smiling. There was no assurance that they’d high five me back. We live in a society where mistrust is the norm.

> 我自觉的笑着然后伸出我的手.我能确保 ta 们一定会回应我的击掌.我们活在一个不相信任的世界里面.

But 9 cases out of 10, the other person would high five me. Their face would break into a smile, and we’d share this moment of electric joy that would never have happened between two strangers otherwise.

> 但 9/10 的是,那些人会和我击掌.ta 们会笑着,然后我们分享着本来不该存在两个陌生人之间触电的瞬间.

It was amazing.

> 这有点小确幸.

They walked away with a little extra bounce in their step.

> ta 们带着小小的兴奋继续 ta 们的脚步.

And so did I.

> 我也一样.

Who knows what such ripples of happiness can create?

> 谁知道会有什么样的幸福的涟漪出现呢?

I realized that we’ve got a chronic deficit of kindness.

> 我发现我们对善意还远远不足.

And that working on it one high five a time—

> 如果解决从每一次击掌开始...

Is not a bad way of tipping the scales.

> 这对于减少善意的赤字也不是一个坏的方法.

## 你被同性恋接触过吗?你是怎么应对 ta 们的?

From:&nbsp; [Have you ever been approached by a homosexual? How did you respond to it?](http://qr.ae/TUGxYQ)

Date: October 16 2018

I was totally approached by a homosexual.

> 我绝对和一个同性恋接触过了.

It was the first day on my new job.

> 那还是我第一天在新公司上班的时候.

My mom and I’ve been so poor after my dad left, that we hardly had anything to eat to get by.

> 我妈和我在我老爸离开之后变得很穷,甚至连吃的东西都没有.

I was fighting a raging eating disorder, in and out of hospitals, barely hanging on.

> 我那时正在竭尽全力解决温饱,来回在医院里面,差点就撑不下去了.

Disregarding all my education, I was looking for any job to get us through, working at cafes and pizza places for tips.

> 不考虑我的文凭,我开始寻找一份工作来支撑我们走下去,在一家咖啡和披萨店里面靠小费活下去.

Then somehow, like a miracle, I got a job as a receptionist in a prestigious, famous, Croatian luxury hotel. It was a dream come true.

> 然而,就像一个奇迹一样,我得到了一份在克罗地亚风格豪华酒店的接待员的工作.梦想成真了.(终于可以活下去了,我想)

I got there on my first day, entering training with the other new employees. I was nervous, self conscious, and scared. I was weak and exhausted. I had no money at all, even to pay for coffee or lunch.

> 我第一天去到那里的时候,进去和其他的新员工一起接受培训.我有点紧张,有点过虑,还有点害怕.我很虚弱和疲倦.我一点钱都没有了,甚至连自己的咖啡和午餐都没钱支付了.

It was then when a homosexual approached me.

> 就是那一刻,那个同性恋,接近了我.

He came straight at me, with the widest smile I ever saw. He looked at me through his posh glasses, and said in a loud voice full of warmth:

> 他直接走到我面前,我曾见过最大的微笑.透过他的眼镜看着我,然后用很 charming 的声音说:

HI.

> Hello world.

He sat next to me throughout the lectures, and then a break came.

> 他坐在我的身旁,一起度过了那个讲座,然后课间休息时候到了.

Everyone got ready to go for lunch, and I pretended to be busy, collecting my scripts and notes, until they all left.

> 每个人都在准备去吃午饭,我假装我很忙,收拾着我的笔记,直到 ta 们全部都离开了.

All but one.

> 但除了他还在.

The homosexual stayed behind. When I clumsily said that I wasn’t that hungry and that I’d take a walk, he said with that same warm smile:

> 那个同性恋留了下来.当我说我不是很饿,我想出去走走,他带着暖暖的笑说:

Oh, we’ll take a walk later, let’s go, girl, I’ll buy you lunch!

> 好的,我们会在晚些时候走走的,出去吧.honey,我会请你这顿饭的.

We went for lunch together and I had a real meal for the first time in many days.

> 我们一起去吃午饭了,这是我那么多天以来第一顿像样的午餐.

Throughout lunch, we laughed, talked and shared.

> 在吃午饭的时候,我们笑着,谈论着和分享着彼此的东西.

The homosexual gave me a break from worry, sickness and fear.

> 那个同性恋给我了能从焦虑,病态和害怕里面休息一下.

We became good friends and colleagues for many years after that. He’d been through ridicule, hardship and despair in his life and it was natural to him to notice when someone else was in a bad place.

> 在这之后我们成为了好朋友和同事很多年.在他生活里面,他曾度过一段荒唐,艰难而又绝望的时光,这让他很容易就注意到旁边哪些人过得不好.

So yes, a homosexual totally approached me. He approached me and it made all the difference.

> 所以,一个同性恋接近了我.然后他改变我的一切.

This is the first time I called him a homosexual, actually. It is the least important fact about him.

> 这是我第一次叫他同性恋,算起来.这是关于他是一个无关紧要的东西吧.

He is a loyal friend, a beautiful human and a guy who adores running and trains hard for marathons. He is a goofy comedian, a fashion go-to advisor and a survivor who never gave up.

> 他是一个很好的朋友啦,一个好人,能为跑马拉松而艰苦训练啦.他是 goofy 的喜剧演员,一个时尚达人,同时还是一个从来不放弃的幸存者.(survivor,并不是所有不 give up 的都能 survivor)

He is also a homosexual.

> 他同时还是一个同性恋.

I wish there were more people like him in this world.

> 我希望在这个世界有更多的人喜欢他.

## 你认识那些隐藏很深的人吗?

From:&nbsp; [Have you ever lived next to a neighbor that had a terrible secret you didn't know until much later?](http://qr.ae/TUGmwv)

Date: October 17 2018

Definitely a secret but not a terrible one. I was a tenent of a gentleman in Delhi. Let us call him Mr.P. I stayed with my family on their 1st floor for 6 years. P told me he worked for Govt. Of India.

> 我认识一个隐藏得很深的,但不是恐怖的人.我那时还是一个砖头们在德里.我们把 ta 叫做 Mr.P 吧.我们家在 ta 的一楼里面待了 6 年.P 告诉我们 ta 是为政府工作的.

One evening his younger daughter came to borrow a folding bed from us. When she could not carry it , I carried it for her downstairs . The way to their bedroom was through the drawing room. There was a guest sitting in the drawing room. He looked familiar, but I could not place him.We nodded at each other; P smiled. I left the bedding and came back. Two days later splashed across the newspaper was the face of the guest , I had seen in P's drawing room. The guy in the news was a big leader from Darjeeling and had just signed a peace agreement with Govt. Of India. I was stunned and went to see Mr.P same evening. He told me that the fellow from Darjeeling was some Tea Plantation guys common friend. I was not satisfied but I let it go.

> 一个晚上,ta 的女儿来到我们这边借折叠床.但她拿不起来,所以我把她那下楼去.去她房间的时候会经过他们的客厅.那里有一位客人坐在客厅里面.那个客人看起来很熟悉,但我想不起来是谁.我们彼此点了一下头.P 笑了一下.我离开他女孩的房间然后回去.两天后,我在报纸上看见了那个客人的照片,我在 P 客厅里面看见的那个客人的照片.那个男人在报纸里面是一个来自 Darjeeling 的大首领,刚和政印度府签订和平协议.我吃了一惊,然后那晚去找 Mrp.他告诉我那个大首领刚好是一些茶商的朋友.我不满足这样的答案,但是我没问太多.

Two years later Mr.P retired and put up a picture of him receiving a Police Vashisht Seva Medal from the President of India on the Drawing Room mantle. It was then he told us that he was a RAW officer . And some of his exploits including why his hand was so badly mauled and why he wore a wig etc.

> 两年后,Mr.p 退休了,拿出了一张他被总统在`白宫`授予 ta 奖章的照片.然后 ta 告诉我们 ta 是 Raw 里面的人(The Research and Analysis Wing:智库).这就说明了 ta 的手受过严重的上然后为什么 ta 带着假发了.

Even his wife and children came to know about his real job only a few days before we came to know. Otherwise he was an extremely ordinary looking man. None of his family knew that he was fluent in mandarin and Nepali .

> 即使是 ta 的老婆和孩子也是在我们知道之前的前几天才知道 ta 的工作实质是什么.顺便一提 ta 看起来就和普通人一模一样.ta 的家庭成员一个也不知道他能说流利的普通话和尼泊尔语言.

Talk of double life..

> 这就是双重人生吧.

The reason for going anonymous is obvious.

> 为什么匿名还不显而易见吗?

## 作家是什么体验?

From:&nbsp; [What is it like to be a writer?](http://qr.ae/TUGqcr)

Date: October 18 2018

Almost every movie has a scene like this.

> 差不多每一部电影都有这样子的场景.

A couple, kissing under the doorframe. He fumbles with the keys. They trip inside, grope as they push against the entrance wall.

> 一对狗男女,在门外虐狗.然后 ta 掏出钥匙.然后跑到屋子里面,在入口的墙上壁咚.

They jostle around. He spots the dining room table. It is covered in piles of stuff.

> 他们游走在各处.他看见了厨房里面的桌子.那上面只有一点其他的东西.

He releases her, turns around, leans both his forearms on the table and sweeps everything to the floor, everything, then sets her down on the now cleared, spacious surface.

> 他们宽衣解带,来来去去,把桌子上的东西都推到地上,所有的东西,然后把 ta 放到干净的桌子上.(汉尼拔会心一笑)

Writing carries this same urgency.

> 写作也是这么急的一件事.

Excuse me - I have to go. Just let me go. My brain has been trying to articulate this thought, is starting to organize it. I just need to put it down, to pin it, fast. I don’t want to lose it. If I do, it will be gone forever.

> 窝草-我要走了.真的要走了.我脑子里面开始有灵感了,而且越来越清晰了.我只需要把 ta 记录下来,标记出来.快点.我不想丢掉这个灵感.如果我丢掉了,就永远的失去了.

I look for a space, a surface, privacy, silence, shush, go away, everyone go away, and spot a table covered in stuff and lean my forearms down and sweep it clean.

> 我寻找一个安静而又不显眼的地方,shh,都走开,都走开,然后看见一张上面只有一点东西的桌子,然后我把上面的东西清理干净.

I pull out a notebook or a napkin or a crayon or my computer and sit down and oh my god finally. I write.

> 我拿出一个本子或者一张纸巾,或者蜡笔或者我的电脑,坐下来,最后,我终于要写一点东西了.

## 怎样会毁掉自己的职业生涯?

From:&nbsp; [What thing secretly destroys people's career?](http://qr.ae/TUG69a)

Date: October 18 2018

Coasting.

> 划水.(混日子)

Once you've been in a job for a couple years, you're likely to reach a position where you can do the job with ease. You know all the right people, all the tools and technology, all the tricks. You've seen all the problems before. You can work without having to work. It's a great deal.

> 一旦在一个职位里面待上许多年,你会找更简单去处理那些事的方法,所有的工具和技术都是你熟悉,还有你知道所有的坑.你在之前就看过这些问题了.你可以不用动手都解决了问题.这也是很好的一个方面.

Until it isn't. You get passed over for promotion in favor of someone with better “trajectory”. You try to find another job, but you don't know the technologies they're looking for. When you do get an interview, they ask you about situations you've never faced, things someone else always took care of. Eventually you settle for a position with lower pay at a crappy company. And you swear never to coast again.

> 但其实并不是的.你升职被别人有更好的`表现`而否决的时候.你想找另一份工作,但你不知道 ta 们现在需要什么样的技术.当你得到一个面试的时候,ta 们问一些你没看过的问题但其他人一直在处理的问题.最后你找到一份工资更低的外包公司.然后你才发誓你不会再划水了.

As soon as your job seems easy, find a way to make it harder or find a new one.

> 一旦你的工作变简单了,找一个让 ta 变难的方法,或者跳槽吧.(生于忧患)

## 你想说什么?

From:&nbsp; [What is something that needs to be said?](http://qr.ae/TUGQ8A)

Date: October 22 2018

I saw a video about a prostitute on YouTube, she told that she wanted money and so she got into it and now she can't come out of it because if she joins a new job there is someone there who knows about her and the people are no more seeing her as a women but a prostitute.

> 我在 you2 上看到一个关于性工作者的视频,她说她想要钱,所以她进入了那个行业,但现在她出不来了,因为她找到了一份新工作,而那里有人知道她是性工作者,然后那些人就不当她是一个女人,而是一个妓女了.

Some people come to interview her, like that one day a guy came to interview her and asked so many questions about her job and rate and everything and his last question was if she was free that night.

> 一些人来询问她,就像有一天有一个男的来询问她,问了她关于工作的很多问题,等级和其他的一些东西,而他的最后一个问题是她今晚有没有空.

She also said some people do it all night long and it's paining, some people just want to see her naked and one time she was just seen naked for 6 hours and that's not a easy thing for a girl.

> 她还说一些人可以一整晚都在问这些东西,这让她很痛苦,一些人仅仅想看见她的裸体,有一次她 6 个小时都在裸着,这对一个女孩子来说,怎么都是一件不容易的事.

She said that was just her profession, she had started it and now even if she wanted to end it, she couldn't because of the society. End of the day everyone want money.

> 她说着仅仅是她的职业而已,她开始了,而现在尽管她想结束那样子的生活,但因为现在的社会,她结束不了.最后,每个人都不是需要钱吗.

The main thing that got my attention was the comments of some MEN. They told "They knew respectful women who work hard to earn that 5000 rs. However you justify this, this is very wrong. There are 1000 ways to earn money, only shameless person will sleep with 1000 people".

> 引起我的主意的是一些来自 Men 的评论. ta 们说"ta 们知道怎么尊重一个通过努力工作赚取 5000rs 的女孩子.不论你怎么证明你自己,你都是错的.那本来就有很多的方式去赚钱,而只有毫无羞耻的才会去做性工作者"

I just have one question, are those 1000 people not shameless? They pay for it, so is it not wrong? If what that women does is wrong then what about the other person? Why is no one talking bad about them?

> 我只有一个问题,那 1000 个人就没错?ta 们为这个付款,所以这就没错?如果女孩做这个是错的,那些人呢?那为什么不喷 ta 们?

Even after having so many prostitutes in this country, people are so shameless and they rape women, children and even a goat. Imagine if there is no prostitution what will happen to this country! Products increase only based on the demand in the first place right?

> 尽管在这个国家有那么多的性工作者了,男的还是那么无耻,他们还是会强奸妇女,儿童,甚至山羊(窝草,这是什么情况).想象一下如果没有这些性工作者会发生什么事.最初,都是需求决定生成的,对吧?

I am not trying to justify her but I just wanted to say that even the person who pays for it also does the same mistake, then why is the prostitute alone facing problems and getting all the hate?

> 我不是去为她证明什么,我只是想说即使那些嫖客也一样是错的,那为什么仅仅有性工作面临这些问题和所有的憎恨?

## 在生活里面,你很久才领悟到的是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What did you learn too late in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGdjY)

Date: October 22 2018

Love is a transient feeling. It fades with time and mood.

> 爱情只是短暂的感觉.随着心情和时间而消逝.

Your problems are gossip and “timepass” for EVERYONE even your bestfriend. The only people who actually care are your parents. No one else. Not even your siblings. Eg. If you fail an exam, your relatives may only sympathize with you, your parents are the ones who will actually face headache and look for solutions.

> 你的问题被每一个当做笑料,即使是你的好朋友.那些真正在意你的只有你的父母了.没有其他人了.即使是你的兄弟姐妹.例如,如果你在一场考试失败了,你的亲属只会同情一下你,然而你的父母才是为你头疼,同时去寻求解决方法的人.

The key to happiness is acceptance. If your girlfriend or boyfriend dumped you or cheated on you, accept it wasn’t meant to be. Accept that someone more worthy is meant to be in your life. Pity them and move on.

> 接受才是通往幸福之路的 BMW.如果你的男朋友或者女朋友劈腿或者出轨了,接受 ta 而不是指这件事就该发生.接受其他人比 ta 在你生命里面有着更重的分量.可怜一下前任,然后头也不回的走了.

Bad terrifying breakups are a blessing. You will ONLY realise it after couple of years of having broken up with someone you really loved. Breakups change your whole perspective and make you mature.

> 一哭二闹三上吊的分手是件好事.你会在多年以后才会发现你和你真正喜欢的人分手了.分手改变了你人生观同时让你成熟一点.

Sex is a mere act. Its highly overrated and has 0 significance. Its hyped for no reason. Sex has nothing to do with love. Having sex doesn’t guarantee a long lasting relationship. Its just an act.

> 性只是一部分.被高估和没有一点意义的.有些时候就发生了,没有任何缘故.sex 和 love 是不同的.有 sex 不代表能得到一段长久的陪伴.sex 仅仅是 sex.

There is nothing wrong. There is nothing right. There are only consequences.

> 没有错,没有对,发生就是发生了.

Life is about perspective. As i said theres nothing wrong and theres nothing right. Eg. You tell a pornstar having sex is wrong, he or she will laugh at you. You tell a soldier killing people is wrong, he won’t give a shit about your opinion. Everyone functions as per their own perspective.

> 生活是关于个人观点的.就像我说的没有对和错的.比如你告诉色情明星性交是错的,ta 们会冷冷一笑的.你告诉士兵杀人是不对的,ta 连鸟都懒得鸟你.每个人的行动都建立在自己的个人观点的.

The main cause of misery in life is having association with negative people.if you are surrounded with positive and like minded people the chances of you being depressed reduces exponentially.

> 生活最大的悲惨就是和负面的人有关联.如果你周围都是那些积极的人(传销?)然后

Life begins after no contact. If you are dealing with someone toxic(eg. Ex gf/bf)

> 生活是从失去交集开始的.如果你当时的交集是有毒的人的话.

Being friends with an ex who dumped you will only cause more pain. Cause the day they get a new partner,guess what,they will dump you again. That will hurt more.

> 做前任的朋友会让你更加痛苦.因为 ta 们有新的另一半的时候,ta 们会再次抛弃你.这会让伤害扩大.

As Conor McGregor says - “theres no talent here. Iam obsessed”. if you think of it,work for it,dream about it,talk about it, do everything based on that 1 thing you want - the universe will make sure you get it. Feel it in your blood. Without saying , work your ass off towards it.

> 就像 Conor Mcgregor 说的那样-"轮不到天赋,我只是更专注而已"--如果你思考 ta,努力去解决 ta,连睡觉都想着 ta,谈话都带着 ta,做任何事都是基于你想要的那件事上-整个宇宙都会给你让路的.沉默的热血着,

Donot COMMITT to any guy or girl till the age of 24 minimum. Be loyal ofcourse but dont committ. Choices change as you mature.

> 在你 24 之前不要认定谁是你的 value(单身狗凄然一笑).忠诚但不认定.选择让你成熟(窝草,就是那句选择比努力更重要了???).

If you are going through a rough patch, keep reiterrating to yourself that everything happens for the best and you will grow stronger due to this experience.

> 如果你现在过得很艰难,保持继续尝试,然后就会发生好事了,在这次之后你也会变得更强一点.

Time heals EVERYTHING, but only if you let it. So when something bad happens, be optimistic about the future.

> 时间会治愈任何的东西,如果你允许的话.如果一些坏事发生了,对未来要乐观一点.

With most emotional bonds which dont work out. Strange fact: you start off as strangers and you end up being strangers.

> 大多数的关系都没能维持下来.奇怪的是: 开始是陌生人,最后还是陌生人.
