“Bill Gates recommends you read these 30 books.”

"比尔盖茨吐血推荐你去看这 30 本书."

“Steve Jobs attributes his success to how he takes a shit in the morning.”

"Steve jobs 把 ta 的成功归功于每天早上排放排泄物."

“I interviewed 1,000 millionaires, here's what they all have in common.”

"我采访过 1000 个百万富翁,这是 ta 们具有的共同点."

Dude, if success could be achieved by following Steve Jobs’ early morning poop routine, everyone would be successful.

姐们,如果通过一步一步执行 Steve jobs 早上的拉粑粑日期可以获得成功的话,每个人都成功了.

All of these college dropouts are geniuses and have the entrepreneurial spark. No amount of reading or clicking on shitty links will make you as successful as them.

这些退学都是天才(天才和退学是没有关联的)然后还有商业头脑.而不是看多少书,点击了多少鸡汤连接就可以让你像 ta 们那样成功的.

I am tired of being shoved these crap articles into my face and my friends thinking they're hot shit because they read Freakonomics.

我尝试把这些垃圾都从我脸上甩下去,但是我的朋友看了一些江湖上流传的经济学偏方之后,觉得这些玩意是一坨暖心的玩意.

That's not how life works people.

生活不是那样子的.

## 什么东西,你知道太迟了?

My dad raised my sister and I after our mother passed away in an accident when I was 6 and she was 8. Dad never spoke very much unless you asked him a question. He did not date he just went to work and came home and took care of us. I know my dad loved us and he always smiled but getting him to talk was like pulling teeth.

我爸在我姐 8 岁,我 6 岁的时候,我们的母亲因为意外去世后抚养我们长大.我爸除了你问 ta 问题之外,很少出声了.ta 没有再去和别的人约会,就去上班下班,然后就回家照顾我们了.我知道我爸是爱我们的,ta 喜欢笑,但是让 ta 说话就像拔掉 ta 的牙一样.

In HS I was a linebacker at our little HS and dad never missed a game. My sister played the flute in school and he went to all her concerts. All the other kids had outgoing parents and my dad was 5:10 140 pounds of quiet average and I used to really envy the laughter and camraderie the other guys had with their dads and mine was just smiling and so silent.

在我们的小高中,我打橄榄球的分卫,我爸每一场比赛都来看了.我姐在学校里面吹长笛,ta 也去了每一次我姐的音乐会.其他小屁孩的父母都很外向的样子(当然,不外向,你还能看到?),但是我爸才 160cm 65kg 左右的沉默的人,我过去总是很羡慕那些和 ta 们父母一起笑,得到称赞的小屁孩,而我爸就只会沉默的笑着.

On weekends he went fishing and took us with him if we wanted to go. We were always welcome and though I know he loved us he never had anything to say. Trying to talk to dad was just a lot of 1–2 word answers and then “glad we had this talk son.”

在星期的时候,ta 喜欢去钓鱼,如果我们想去的话,ta 会带上我们.ta 一直想我们陪伴在左右,所以我觉得 ta 是爱我们的只是没说出来而已.你尝试和 ta 交谈的时候,ta 给出一两个答案之后,就会进入标准回答"和你交谈很开心呀"

After college I moved away to Nashville about 4 hours from dad and then after a number of years he was in his 70s and got sick and passed away. At the funeral there were few people in attendance just some guys from his work, my sister and I and our families and an Army General in full uniform who formerly saluted my father and then sat in the back and said some prayers and got up to leave.

在大学后,我搬到离 ta 有四个小时远的 Nashville 那边,在多年以后,ta 在 70 岁的时候因病去世了.在 ta 的葬礼上面,只有 ta 一起工作的一些人参加,我和我姐还有我们的家庭,然后还有一个一身军装的将军在那里称赞我爸,然后就坐在后面,说了一些祈祷的话,然后就想起身离开了.

At the door I introduced myself and asked him if he knew my dad? He said that he had been a Captain in France and your dad was my specialty sergeant and he stopped a German advance in its tracks and destroyed 2 gun emplacements and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. We lost 8 men that day but 25 of us survived that day because your dad was the bravest SOB I ever saw or knew.

在门口的地方,我向将军介绍了我自己,然后问将军是不是认识我爸? 他说他在法国的时候是一个队长,而我爸是他的最特别的一个士兵,我爸曾击退德国人的进攻,然后还摧毁了 2 个炮位得到了勋章.我们那次战斗损失了 8 个人,但是因为你父亲的英勇,我们 25 个人存活了下来.

Needless to say I was in shock. In a shoebox at home buried in a closet was the medal of honor and the duplicate they give you for ceremonies, the rosette, the citation signed by Truman in 1945, a silver star and the croix de guerre with palm from France.

不用说我多吃惊了.在家里面藏在衣柜的一个鞋盒里面,我发现了那些勋章.那里面有杜鲁门在 1945 年签署的"玫瑰花环","银星勋章"和"法国棕榈勋章".

God I wish I could have heard all this from Dad. Does he know how proud I am of him?

要是我能听到 ta 自己说这些就好了. ta 知道我对 ta 有多骄傲吗?

## 当你伴侣脱掉衣服的时候,你觉得什么恶心到你了?

From:&nbsp;[What's the most disgusting thing you've found when your partner took off their clothes?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-disgusting-thing-youve-found-when-your-partner-took-off-their-clothes/answer/Haida-Kato)

I met this girl not too long ago; she was very pretty and from Japan like yours truly, so I decided to help her around town.

在不久前,我碰到了这个女孩子.ta 很漂亮,来自日本,就像你想的那样子,所以我决定去帮助熟悉这个镇子.

Something a little strange about her that I didn’t pay much attention to was that she always wore long-sleeved turtlenecks, or anything that would cover her neck and arms.

关于 ta 有一点奇怪的是,之前我没留意到 ta 一直穿着长袖高圆领的衣服,或者其他能遮住 ta 脖子和手臂的东西.

I knew she grew a liking to me, with me being a little dismissive at first, because the “How could anyone love me?” mentality. I slowly warmed up and we started being flirty.

我知道 ta 对我的好感日益剧增,刚开始我很不理解,因为我的"怎么可能会有人喜欢我?"的人设.后面,我开始膨胀了,和 ta 相互撩骚.

After a while, we went on our first date.

一段日子过后,我们去了我们的第一次约会.

A cafe, one of those millennial trend types of places.

咖啡店,在一个比较潮流的地方里面.

She showed up and said hi nervously, and we sat down at a table near a window. While we were talking, I noticed she tapped the table with her fingers, and whenever we would stop talking she would look out the window and just stare at the people walking by. Sometimes adjusting her turtleneck’s collar and sleeves up.

ta 来到的时候很紧张的打了一下招呼,然后我们坐在一张靠着窗口的桌子前.在我们说话那会,我注意到 ta 喜欢用手指敲到桌面,不论什么停掉交谈的时候,ta 总是盯着窗外,看人来人往.有些时候 ta 就整理一下 ta 的长袖和衣服.

She was anxious. Understandable, I sometimes look a little bit intimidating because I have a natural cold stare and I like wearing leather jackets.

ta 很紧张.可以理解,我有时看起来比较吓人,因为我喜欢冷冷的盯着别人,而且喜欢穿皮革外套.

When I went to get the coffee, I came back with a cookie as well. She laughed because it seemed so weird from the way I looked.

当我去拿咖啡回来的时候,我还拿了一点饼干.ta 笑了,因为我那天看起来挺奇怪的.

It went really well. We went on a few more dates, each time she got more and more nervous. I assumed it was because she was an anxious person, I didn’t pressure her - it seemed like a difficult topic.

看起来都很好的样子.我们又约会多了几次,每一次 ta 都更紧张了.我只是觉得 ta 是一个比较不安的人,我没去问 ta-这看起来很难开口.

Then we went and hung out in each other’s apartments.

然后我们都去对方的公寓逛啦.

After a few weeks of dating, she said in a sad tone, “This is the longest I have ever dated someone.”

在几个星期的约会之后,ta 忧伤的说,"这是我人生中最长的一次约会了."

I asked why, and she said that she was dreading this day.

我问为什么,ta 说 ta 这些天都快紧张到崩溃了.

She uncovered her arms and neck, revealing burn scars — it looked like snakes made of fire coiled around her arms and neck. The rest of her body also had this bizarre coil.

ta 把长袖拿掉露出手臂和脖子,展露那些疤痕-看起来就像被油炸过的蛇缠绕在 ta 的手臂和脖子上面.ta 身体上的其他部分也有着其他伤痕.

This is why she was so anxious, why she wears long sleeves.

这就是 ta 为什么紧张,为什么穿长袖的原因了.

And you know what I did?

你知道我做了什么吗?

I hugged her.

我抱了 ta 一下.

The most disgusting thing about this is not her scars, it’s that she has to hide them, to keep people from judging and staring.

最恶心我的不是 ta 的疤痕,而是 ta 必须要去隐藏那些疤痕,才能远离那些碎嘴的人.

That, is what I found most disgusting.

这就是我发现最恶心的事了.

Follow-up: I am still dating her - I swear she’s my soul-mate, and I wouldn’t have her any other way.

更新: 我们还在一起呀,我知道 ta 是我的另一半,而且我不能失去 ta.

I didn’t think it would explode like this. I appreciate all the stories and praise from all of you, and I hope all of you have fantastic lives.

我不知道会有这么多点赞.我感谢你们所有的故事和赞扬,希望你们也有一个精彩的人生.

Sometimes I think about how interwoven our lives have become and it makes my heart swell. Other times it makes me want to vomit from fear.

有些时候,我想起我们共同虐狗的生活有多么好的时候让我有点小膨胀.但其他时间我很害怕,都几乎要吐了.

If I decline sex, it’s usually because I’m not feeling great about my body that day, not because I don’t want to have sex with you.

If we have an inside joke about cacti, get me one. I’ll appreciate it more than some overpriced dinner.

如果我们有一个关于仙人掌的笑话,给我说呀.这比去吃顿贵的东西更让我感激.

I do notice when you don’t brush your teeth. I just pretend not to. I choose to kiss you anyway. Afterwards I brush my teeth, floss, and rinse.
