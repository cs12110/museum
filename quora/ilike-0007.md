## 什么事,你都听腻了?

“Bill Gates recommends you read these 30 books.”

"比尔盖茨吐血推荐你去看这 30 本书."

“Steve Jobs attributes his success to how he takes a shit in the morning.”

"Steve jobs 把 ta 的成功归功于每天早上排放排泄物."

“I interviewed 1,000 millionaires, here's what they all have in common.”

"我采访过 1000 个百万富翁,这是 ta 们具有的共同点."

Dude, if success could be achieved by following Steve Jobs’ early morning poop routine, everyone would be successful.

姐们,如果通过一步一步执行 Steve jobs 早上的拉粑粑日期可以获得成功的话,每个人都成功了.

All of these college dropouts are geniuses and have the entrepreneurial spark. No amount of reading or clicking on shitty links will make you as successful as them.

这些退学都是天才(天才和退学是没有关联的)然后还有商业头脑.而不是看多少书,点击了多少鸡汤连接就可以让你像 ta 们那样成功的.

I am tired of being shoved these crap articles into my face and my friends thinking they're hot shit because they read Freakonomics.

我尝试把这些垃圾都从我脸上甩下去,但是我的朋友看了一些江湖上流传的经济学偏方之后,觉得这些玩意是一坨暖心的玩意.

That's not how life works people.

生活不是那样子的.

## 什么东西,你知道太迟了?

From:&nbsp;[What is something you wish you had known sooner?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-wish-you-had-known-sooner)

My dad raised my sister and I after our mother passed away in an accident when I was 6 and she was 8. Dad never spoke very much unless you asked him a question. He did not date he just went to work and came home and took care of us. I know my dad loved us and he always smiled but getting him to talk was like pulling teeth.

我爸在我姐 8 岁,我 6 岁的时候,我们的母亲因为意外去世后抚养我们长大.我爸除了你问 ta 问题之外,很少出声了.ta 没有再去和别的人约会,就去上班下班,然后就回家照顾我们了.我知道我爸是爱我们的,ta 喜欢笑,但是让 ta 说话就像拔掉 ta 的牙一样.

In HS I was a linebacker at our little HS and dad never missed a game. My sister played the flute in school and he went to all her concerts. All the other kids had outgoing parents and my dad was 5:10 140 pounds of quiet average and I used to really envy the laughter and camraderie the other guys had with their dads and mine was just smiling and so silent.

在我们的小高中,我打橄榄球的分卫,我爸每一场比赛都来看了.我姐在学校里面吹长笛,ta 也去了每一次我姐的音乐会.其他小屁孩的父母都很外向的样子(当然,不外向,你还能看到?),但是我爸才 160cm 65kg 左右的沉默的人,我过去总是很羡慕那些和 ta 们父母一起笑,得到称赞的小屁孩,而我爸就只会沉默的笑着.

On weekends he went fishing and took us with him if we wanted to go. We were always welcome and though I know he loved us he never had anything to say. Trying to talk to dad was just a lot of 1–2 word answers and then “glad we had this talk son.”

在星期的时候,ta 喜欢去钓鱼,如果我们想去的话,ta 会带上我们.ta 一直想我们陪伴在左右,所以我觉得 ta 是爱我们的只是没说出来而已.你尝试和 ta 交谈的时候,ta 给出一两个答案之后,就会进入标准回答"和你交谈很开心呀"

After college I moved away to Nashville about 4 hours from dad and then after a number of years he was in his 70s and got sick and passed away. At the funeral there were few people in attendance just some guys from his work, my sister and I and our families and an Army General in full uniform who formerly saluted my father and then sat in the back and said some prayers and got up to leave.

在大学后,我搬到离 ta 有四个小时远的 Nashville 那边,在多年以后,ta 在 70 岁的时候因病去世了.在 ta 的葬礼上面,只有 ta 一起工作的一些人参加,我和我姐还有我们的家庭,然后还有一个一身军装的将军在那里称赞我爸,然后就坐在后面,说了一些祈祷的话,然后就想起身离开了.

At the door I introduced myself and asked him if he knew my dad? He said that he had been a Captain in France and your dad was my specialty sergeant and he stopped a German advance in its tracks and destroyed 2 gun emplacements and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. We lost 8 men that day but 25 of us survived that day because your dad was the bravest SOB I ever saw or knew.

在门口的地方,我向将军介绍了我自己,然后问将军是不是认识我爸? 他说他在法国的时候是一个队长,而我爸是他的最特别的一个士兵,我爸曾击退德国人的进攻,然后还摧毁了 2 个炮位得到了勋章.我们那次战斗损失了 8 个人,但是因为你父亲的英勇,我们 25 个人存活了下来.

Needless to say I was in shock. In a shoebox at home buried in a closet was the medal of honor and the duplicate they give you for ceremonies, the rosette, the citation signed by Truman in 1945, a silver star and the croix de guerre with palm from France.

不用说我多吃惊了.在家里面藏在衣柜的一个鞋盒里面,我发现了那些勋章.那里面有杜鲁门在 1945 年签署的"玫瑰花环","银星勋章"和"法国棕榈勋章".

God I wish I could have heard all this from Dad. Does he know how proud I am of him?

要是我能听到 ta 自己说这些就好了. ta 知道我对 ta 有多骄傲吗?

## 当你伴侣脱掉衣服的时候,你觉得什么恶心到你了?

From:&nbsp;[What's the most disgusting thing you've found when your partner took off their clothes?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-disgusting-thing-youve-found-when-your-partner-took-off-their-clothes/answer/Haida-Kato)

I met this girl not too long ago; she was very pretty and from Japan like yours truly, so I decided to help her around town.

在不久前,我碰到了这个女孩子.ta 很漂亮,来自日本,就像你想的那样子,所以我决定去帮助熟悉这个镇子.

Something a little strange about her that I didn’t pay much attention to was that she always wore long-sleeved turtlenecks, or anything that would cover her neck and arms.

关于 ta 有一点奇怪的是,之前我没留意到 ta 一直穿着长袖高圆领的衣服,或者其他能遮住 ta 脖子和手臂的东西.

I knew she grew a liking to me, with me being a little dismissive at first, because the “How could anyone love me?” mentality. I slowly warmed up and we started being flirty.

我知道 ta 对我的好感日益剧增,刚开始我很不理解,因为我的"怎么可能会有人喜欢我?"的人设.后面,我开始膨胀了,和 ta 相互撩骚.

After a while, we went on our first date.

一段日子过后,我们去了我们的第一次约会.

A cafe, one of those millennial trend types of places.

咖啡店,在一个比较潮流的地方里面.

She showed up and said hi nervously, and we sat down at a table near a window. While we were talking, I noticed she tapped the table with her fingers, and whenever we would stop talking she would look out the window and just stare at the people walking by. Sometimes adjusting her turtleneck’s collar and sleeves up.

ta 来到的时候很紧张的打了一下招呼,然后我们坐在一张靠着窗口的桌子前.在我们说话那会,我注意到 ta 喜欢用手指敲到桌面,不论什么停掉交谈的时候,ta 总是盯着窗外,看人来人往.有些时候 ta 就整理一下 ta 的长袖和衣服.

She was anxious. Understandable, I sometimes look a little bit intimidating because I have a natural cold stare and I like wearing leather jackets.

ta 很紧张.可以理解,我有时看起来比较吓人,因为我喜欢冷冷的盯着别人,而且喜欢穿皮革外套.

When I went to get the coffee, I came back with a cookie as well. She laughed because it seemed so weird from the way I looked.

当我去拿咖啡回来的时候,我还拿了一点饼干.ta 笑了,因为我那天看起来挺奇怪的.

It went really well. We went on a few more dates, each time she got more and more nervous. I assumed it was because she was an anxious person, I didn’t pressure her - it seemed like a difficult topic.

看起来都很好的样子.我们又约会多了几次,每一次 ta 都更紧张了.我只是觉得 ta 是一个比较不安的人,我没去问 ta-这看起来很难开口.

Then we went and hung out in each other’s apartments.

然后我们都去对方的公寓逛啦.

After a few weeks of dating, she said in a sad tone, “This is the longest I have ever dated someone.”

在几个星期的约会之后,ta 忧伤的说,"这是我人生中最长的一次约会了."

I asked why, and she said that she was dreading this day.

我问为什么,ta 说 ta 这些天都快紧张到崩溃了.

She uncovered her arms and neck, revealing burn scars — it looked like snakes made of fire coiled around her arms and neck. The rest of her body also had this bizarre coil.

ta 把长袖拿掉露出手臂和脖子,展露那些疤痕-看起来就像被油炸过的蛇缠绕在 ta 的手臂和脖子上面.ta 身体上的其他部分也有着其他伤痕.

This is why she was so anxious, why she wears long sleeves.

这就是 ta 为什么紧张,为什么穿长袖的原因了.

And you know what I did?

你知道我做了什么吗?

I hugged her.

我抱了 ta 一下.

The most disgusting thing about this is not her scars, it’s that she has to hide them, to keep people from judging and staring.

最恶心我的不是 ta 的疤痕,而是 ta 必须要去隐藏那些疤痕,才能远离那些碎嘴的人.

That, is what I found most disgusting.

这就是我发现最恶心的事了.

Follow-up: I am still dating her - I swear she’s my soul-mate, and I wouldn’t have her any other way.

更新: 我们还在一起呀,我知道 ta 是我的另一半,而且我不能失去 ta.

I didn’t think it would explode like this. I appreciate all the stories and praise from all of you, and I hope all of you have fantastic lives.

我不知道会有这么多点赞.我感谢你们所有的故事和赞扬,希望你们也有一个精彩的人生.

From:&nbsp;[Ladies: what is one thing you want to tell your significant other but just can't?](https://www.quora.com/Ladies-what-is-one-thing-you-want-to-tell-your-significant-other-but-just-cant/answers/114801157)

我在你身上花了超多的钱.我希望你永远不知道是多少.

Sometimes I think about how interwoven our lives have become and it makes my heart swell. Other times it makes me want to vomit from fear.

有些时候,我想起我们共同虐狗的生活有多么好的时候让我有点小膨胀.但其他时间我很害怕,都几乎要吐了.

If I decline sex, it’s usually because I’m not feeling great about my body that day, not because I don’t want to have sex with you.

I love you. I do. But some days, I feel so unappreciated that I question whether I’m stupid for doing so.

If we have an inside joke about cacti, get me one. I’ll appreciate it more than some overpriced dinner.

如果我们有一个关于仙人掌的笑话,给我说呀.这比去吃顿贵的东西更让我感激.

I do notice when you don’t brush your teeth. I just pretend not to. I choose to kiss you anyway. Afterwards I brush my teeth, floss, and rinse.

I love you. Way more than you know. Please stay.

我喜欢你,比你想的更喜欢.请,留下来.

## 作为纹身手艺人,什么让你哭成狗?

From:&nbsp;[As a tattoo artist, what is the saddest meaning behind a tattoo that you’ve heard?](https://www.quora.com/As-a-tattoo-artist-what-is-the-saddest-meaning-behind-a-tattoo-that-you-ve-heard/answers/114620027)

Date: January 03 2019

Oh god I'm going to cry writing this one. Okay. Here we go.

窝草,我会哭着写完这个故事的.好吧,我们现在开始准备好纸巾.

A kid comes in, well not really a kid but not an adult for sure. He was 22 if I remember. He hands me a letter, sealed in an envelope and everything. He never said a word, just standing there alittle nervous. I'm a female artist with the biggest shop in my area, I'm fairly well known and at first I thought, “Oh here we go, some shitty love letter.” I know that sounds cringey but I have honestly had men try to propose a date to me during a session, one guy pulled his member out and asked me if I was impressed, not because I'm some irresistible vixen but because I'm a heavily tattooed woman and some mean like that.

一个小屁孩走进店里面,也不算是小屁孩,当然也不算是大人的那种小屁孩.那会 ta 才 22 岁.ta 递给我一封信,和其他东西密封在一个信封里面.ta 没有说话,站在那里有点小紧张.我是一个在我们那个地区算是杠把子类型的纹身店的女老板了,在我的第一想法里,"窝草,又来了,又是一些恶心人的情书."我知道这听起来有点自恋,但我必须说,那时候还是有男的想追我的,一个男的把 ta 的小伙伴拿出来,问我是不是印象深刻,不是因为我有多大的魅力什么的,而是因为我是一个会纹身的女孩子,而一些男的就喜欢这口.(这样子翻译,求饶命)

I give him a raised brow and open the letter, it was just a small circle with a crude dotted line and X drawn inside it, kind of like a tiny treasure map.

我给 ta 翻了一个 45 度的白眼,然后打开那封信,那里面就只有一个小圆圈,一个有油迹的圆心,还有一个 x 画在里边,就像一个小小的藏宝图.

“Is this what you want today?”

"这是你今天想纹的吗?"

“Yes ma’am.”

"是的,大人"

“Alright, well let me go sketch something up and we’ll talk prices.”

"了解,先让我素描一下,然后我们再谈一下价格."

“Sure, but can you please make it as accurate to that as possible?”

"好的,能否请你画得尽你所能的精确?"

“Yea, I can. It still has to be drawn up so I can put on the stencil.”

"好的,我会的.就算这样子我还是要先画下来,然后才能纹."

“Alright, thank you.”

"了解,谢谢."

Blah blah blah, stencil and prices out of the way, now I'm sitting here tattooing it on his leg.

Blah blah blash,模板和价格都弄好了,现在我坐在那里,在 ta 的脚上纹上这个纹身.

“So is this something you drew?”

"这个是你自己画的东西吗?"

“My dad drew it.”

"我爸画的."

“Okay.” That was that. That's all he said. About 15 minutes later, I notice his leg is quivering.

"好吧."就这样.这就是 ta 说的了.在 15 分钟后,我察觉到 ta 的腿在颤抖.

“Hey are you okay? Your legs sha-” I look up and this kid has big fat tears rolling down his cheeks. His whole body is vibrating as he sniffles and tries to sob, I mean sob, silently.

"喂,你还好吧?你的腿在抖.." 我看向这个小屁孩的时候,我看见 ta 的眼泪都掉到脸颊了.ta 的整个身体因为抽泣而颤抖,而且 ta 还在克制着自己低声的哭泣,我是说那种无声的哭泣.

“Are you okay? Do we need to stop? Do you need some water?”

"你还好吧?我们需要停下来吗?你要不要喝点热水?"

“No, no its okay. I'm sorry, I'll try and hold still.”

"不需要,还好.不好意思呀,我会努力保持不动的."

My mommy instincts kick in, this kid is in pain.

看到这个小屁孩待在痛苦里面,我母爱泛滥了.

“Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?” I take off my glove and reach for his hand. Usually I would find this inappropriate at the work place, I would either call off the session and ask him to come back another day or try and carry on without prying but he looked so... Gone? Like his mind was wondering and wherever it was going was killing him emotionally.

"Hey,出什么事了吗?你还好吧?" 我把手套摘下,握住 ta 的手.通常我觉得这样在在工作的地方很不合适,我一般会取消这次的纹身而叫 ta 其他时间再来,然后继续其他业务而不刺探任何的东西,但 ta 看起来太...失落?就像 ta 很惊奇,但是现在发生的东西正在把 ta 的情感给绞杀掉.

He exploded.

ta 被拆碎了.

“Every year for my birthday my dad would draw me a treasure map to a special gift he got me. That was the best day of every year for me, getting that map and going out looking for my gift. It was always in a new place, the map was always exciting, he would take hours in his study drawing me these little maps so I'd have a great adventure on my birthday. Last year he got in an accident and sustained severe trauma, he made it by the grace of god but the doctors said the damage to his body was horrific at best and he'd have alot of complications and revision surgeries. He couldn't talk and could only barely write to tell us what he needed. This is the last map he drew for me on my birthday before he passed away a few days later. I don't know what its supposed to lead to, I never got a chance to ask him. One day I think I'll find out what that map leads to.”

"每一年,我爸会把我的生日礼物藏起来,然后画一张藏宝图给我.对我来说,那是一年中最好的一天呀.拿到藏宝图,然后去找生日礼物.那些礼物总是在新的地方,藏宝图总是让人很激动,我爸会花上一个多小时去画出这个藏宝图给我,好让我在生日那一天可以有一个惊奇的探险.上一年,我爸遇到了意外,有几次很严重的创伤,我爸好不容易撑过来了.医生说 ta 身体的创伤很严重,ta 还要经过很多的手术和康复治疗.ta 甚至不能说话,只能吃力的画下来告诉我们 ta 需要什么.这就是最后一张藏宝图了,在 ta 去世的前几天给我画好的.我不知道这藏宝图会带我去什么地方,我连问 ta 的机会都没了.在某一天,我想,我会知道这张地图会带我去哪里的."

This kid got the last map his dad ever drew for him permanently on his body.

这个小屁孩把 ta 爸曾经画给 ta 的地图纹在自己的身上了.

When I say I cried, I mean I CRIED. I went home and bawled to my husband. I don't know what that map was supposed to lead to but I know that kid will figure it out one day. I don't know his dads name, but whoever he is, rest in peace. You were so loved and so missed. I can see, just from talking to your son, you were the best dad in the world. You really were.

在我说我哭的时候,我是说我真的哭了.我回到家在我丈夫面前哭得一塌糊涂.我不知道那张地图会指向哪里,但我知道那个小屁孩一定会找到的.我不知道 ta 父亲的名字,甚至连 ta 是谁都不清楚,RIP.你被深爱和被深深的怀念着.我可以看出来,在和你的小屁孩的交谈的时候,你是这个世界上最好的父亲了.你真的是.

## 订披萨做报警策略

From:&nbsp;[Can you actually call 911 and “order a pizza” as a ruse for help?](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-actually-call-911-and-order-a-pizza-as-a-ruse-for-help/answer/Nick-Yates-14)

Date: January 05 2019

I know of one case of this actually happening in the UK.

我知道一件真实发生在英国的案件.

The call went something like this:

那个电话通话大致如下:

Operator: Police Emergency

接听员: 警察局

Caller: Hello, I’d like to order a curry please.

报警人: Hello,我想订一杯饮料.

O: You’re through to the police

接听员: 你打给的是警察局呀

C: Could you deliver it to ‘gives address’

报警人: 你可以送我这个地址吗?

O: Madam, this is the police, not a delivery service

接听员: 夫人,这里是警察局,不是送外卖的.

C: Could you deliver it as soon as possible?

报警人: 你能尽快的送到没?

O: (starting to realise something is wrong) “Madam, are you in a situation where you cannot talk freely?

接听员:(开始意识到事情并不简单)"夫人,你是不是遇到了什么危险而又不能明示的?"

C: Yes.

报警人: 是的.

O: Are you in danger?

接听员: 你现在处于危险之中?

C: Yes.

报警人: 是的.

O: Okay, I’m arranging help for you immediately.

接听员: 好的,我会为你立刻安排援助的.

C: Could you make it two Naan Breads? My husband is really hungry.

报警人: 你还可以送两条面包吗?我的丈夫现在很饿.

O: I’ll send two officers.

接听员: 我会安排两名警察的.

This transcript is purely based on memory from a police officer’s memoir. On the police response, a very angry man was arrested for domestic violence.

这段对话基于接听员的回忆.在接听员的回应里面,一个因为家庭暴力的男子被捕了.

There was obviously the risk that the operator could have hung up on a ‘time-wasting’ caller, but once they realised something was wrong, they changed scripts immediately.

那里肯定有风险那个接听员把这个浪费时间的电话挂掉,但意识到什么不对的时候,他们就会使用暗号了, over.

## 你对女孩子说过什么最不切实际的话?

From:&nbsp;[What is the most accidentally slick thing you said to a girl?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-accidentally-slick-thing-you-said-to-a-girl/answer/Corey-Rippeto-1)

Date: January 14 2019

When I was 8 years old, I was appointed as ring boy in my aunts wedding.

在 8 岁的时候,我被指派为我姑的婚礼上的送戒指的那个男孩子.

The man my aunt was marrying had a niece just 1 year younger than me. She was the flower girl.

我姑嫁的那个男人那边刚好有一个比我小一岁的侄女.ta 也是花童.

Well, I took a liking to her quickly..

好吧,我承认我很快就喜欢 ta 了..

I actually ended up trying to propose to her.. with the wedding ring!

我在最后努力去向 ta 求婚..用那个戒指!

When they first gave me that ring to carry around, I felt like I was given a mission to protect it with my very life.

当 ta 们给我拿着那个戒指的时候,我觉得我有使命用生命去保护那个戒指.

Then, this cute, curly haired girl comes along and I'm down on my knee offering it to her!

然后,那个可爱的,头发有点卷的 ta 来到了,我献出我的膝盖,然后想把戒指给 ta.

Needless to say, I was not able to actually give her the ring..

不用说啦,我不能真正的给 ta 那个戒指..

So, 14 years later she and her mom are at the mall walking by the jewelry store I was working at at the time.

所以,14 年之后,当 ta 和 ta 妈在逛珠宝店的时候,当时我正好在那边工作.

She recognizes me and after passing the store, tells her mom who I am.

ta 认出了我,在经过之后,ta 告诉 ta 妈我是谁.

Her mom then turns around and by accident, loudly says

ta 妈突然就转过身来,然后大声说

“Oh my gosh, that's Corey?!”

"窝草,这就是 Corey?!"

This gets me excited.. and nervous.

这让我很兴奋..也很紧张.

I smile, and say

我笑着,然后说

“Hey! Yeah, it's me! How are you doing?”

"Hey.是的,就是我.进来过得怎样?"

They walk back to me, and her mother asks how I'm doing and if I'm working at this jewelry store.

ta 们走回到我这边,然后 ta 妈问我是不是在这家店铺工作,过得怎样

Without even thinking or skipping a beat, I reply..

来不及思考或者心跳漏了一拍,我回答了..

No, actually 14 years ago I tried giving Shannon a ring, but it was taken away. After that, she ran off on me. I've just been waiting on her to come pick out a ring I can actually give to her. And now here she is.

不,在 14 年前,我想给 ta 一个 Shannon 戒指,但戒指被别人拿走了.在这之后,ta 从我身边离开了.我在等 ta 回来拿这个我可是真正给 ta 的戒指.然后,现在,ta 就在这里了.

I didn't even know what I said, it just came out.

我甚至不记得我说了什么,就那么说出来了.

But her face was sooo red, I knew it hit home.

但 ta 脸变得很红,我知道有戏了.

That was almost 3 years ago.

那大概是三年前了.

I still haven't given her a ring, but we've been dating ever since.

我现在还没给出那个戒指,但从那开始我们就开始虐狗了.

The “slickest" thing I've ever accidentally said to a girl has turned out to also be the best one.

那个我偶然对女孩子说过最却华而不实的东西,最后发现是我说过最好的.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an adorable, curly-haired snoring machine to snuggle up to.

现在,不好意思,我要抱着一个可爱,卷发而又打着鼻鼾的暖手器了.

## 哪一刻改变了你的一生

From:&nbsp;[What was the turning point of your life that changed you completely?](https://qr.ae/TWnQvp)

Date: July 25 2019

When I was 16, the single hottest girl in the year invited me to her fancy dress party.

那年,我 16(汤师爷是这么说的),学校里面最漂亮的那个单身女孩子要请我去一个牛掰的盛装派对.

I was under no illusions. I didn’t think this would mean she wanted to bang me on every piece of furniture in her house like I was her big toe.

我还没傻.我知道这不意味着 ta 想把我像大玩具一样,在 ta 家里面扔来扔去(觉得没这么简单).

But still, a personalized invite from the school babe was something special.

但一个来自校花的个人邀请,还是很特别的.

The problem was I just KNEW my Mum wouldn’t let me go.

可问题是,我刚刚知道我妈不准我去呀.

My Mum was a strict one, and there was study or chores to be done. Fun could wait. So I preempted her decision and accepted my fate.

我妈是很严格的一个人,我还杂务和学习需要去完成.玩乐可以稍稍往后靠一下.所以知道 ta 的决定,然后接受了我的命运.

All week I reminded myself she’d say no, and got on with my life. I told myself that the party wasn’t really for me anyway. It was for the cool kids.

一整个星期,我提醒我自己我妈会不准我去的,然后我又回归我的生活了.我告诉自己那个派对也不是为我举办的,都是为了那些杀马特.

Then, when Saturday rolled around, I went to my Mum and asked her upfront, “Can I go to a fancy dress party tonight? A girl at school invited me”.

然后,星期六如约而至,我去问我妈要预支一点钱,"我今晚能去一个盛装派对吗?一个在学校的女孩子邀请了我."

And after a week of already knowing the answer, and knowing I’d only feel out of place there, my Mum turned around and said…

在经过一个星期消化那个不允许的回复之后,我知道在那里试探出来了,然后我妈回过身对我说:

“Yes”.

**"可以呀"**

I didn’t know what to do. I was so shocked she’d said yes that I froze. It was so out of character and alien that I walked away, wondering what just happened.

我惊慌失措.在她说可以的时候,我被惊呆了.我在走开的时候,就像一个刚到地球的外星人一样,还在想刚才发生了什么.

And you know what I did that night? Nothing.

然后你知道那晚,我做了什么吗? **什么也没做**.

I was too afraid to go to that party. I was so sure I wouldn’t be allowed that I had psyched myself out. I was paralyzed by fear. The moment had passed. And I missed it.

我太害怕去那个派对了.我之前很肯定我不会被允许参加那个派对的,然后兴奋到模糊.是害怕让我麻木了.那个派对过去了.而我也根本没去参加.

The next morning my mate called me. He told me the party had been OFF THE CHAIN. Apparently the school hottie had even asked where I was. She’d been hoping to see me there. But I was at home. Too afraid to take a chance, having already convinced myself that the chance never belonged to me in the first place.

第二天早上,我同学给我消息.ta 告诉我那派对 tmd 好玩了.ta 甚至问我在哪了.ta 还以为在那里可以见到我.但我在家里面了.太害怕去得到,早就说服自己那些机会从来就不属于我自己.

I remember the moment as clear as day. My one and only epiphany in life. I was 16 years old and I said to myself…

那个时刻,依然历历在目.我人生中唯一的一次顿悟.在 16 岁年,我对我自己说:

”Alexander, I know life is scary. But if you say no to opportunities like this, you’ll never have a single story worth telling. You might get hurt, or scared, or even sad, but it’s time to start living life.”

"Alexander,我知道生活很恐怖.但是你对这样的机会说 no 的话,你永远都不会有一个属于自己的故事.你可能会受伤,害怕,甚至是悲伤,但是是时候开始自己的生活了"

And Quorans, you know what happened after that?

然后 Quora 人,你知道在这之后发生了什么吗?

Nothing.

**还是什么也没发生.**

I didn’t change a fucking thing. I was still terrified of the world. Convinced every exciting moment belonged to someone else. And that I would be a fraud if I wanted to experience them myself. So nothing changed at all.

我甚至连一件小事都没改变.我还是对这个世界感到害怕.说服自己那些激动人心的时刻都是别人的.如果我想去经历那些东西的话,我一定会是渣渣来的.所以一点东西也没改变.

4 years later, just after my 20th birthday, I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Leukemia that spirits away life with devastating ease.

4 年后(镜头一转),就在我 20 岁的生日后,我被诊断出患有一种侵略性的白血病,这种病很容易就挂掉了.

And truth be told I had the ‘Life Flashes Before Your Eyes Moment’. The moment my Doctor broke the news that I had cancer, I was forced to watch the highlights of the previous 20 years of my life.

说真的,我也有那些"跑马灯"时候.在医生宣布我有癌症的那一刻,我被逼着去想一下我生命里面有哪些高光的时刻.

And you know what? There wasn’t much to see.

你知道吗?我根本就没什么高光的时刻.

An empty film reel, devoid of experiences, with no stories to tell. Gathering dust in the attic of my mind. A waste of a life not lived.

一部空白的电影,没有什么深刻的经历,没有能告诉别人的故事.在我心上积上了灰尘.我这是浪费生命,而不是生活呀.

I came out of hospital 244 days later.

在 244 天之后,我出院了.

I couldn’t be around crowds. I wasn’t strong enough to handle it. I couldn’t bear the harsh kiss of sunlight. My skin was sensitive and my bones brittle.

我不能待在人多的地方.我还不够强去接受这些.我甚至不能忍受强烈的阳光.我的皮肤很敏感,骨骼很脆弱.

And in that state of weakness. Of loss and despair. I made a decision.

在这么脆弱的时候,在迷失和绝望里面.我做了一个决定.

I made a promise to the 16 year old version of me who was so afraid he might spend time with a pretty girl, that he stayed home.

我对 16 岁那个害怕和漂亮女孩子相处而自己呆在家里面的自己做下了承诺.

And I made a promise to the 20 year old version of me who was so sad and empty with nothing to show for his two decades on planet earth.

我对那个过去 20 多年没有任何故事去分享,生活一片空白的自己做下了承诺.

I promised them - I promised myself - if Leukemia ever came calling again...

我对 ta 们承诺,我对我自己承诺,如果 Leukemia 在打电话过来...

That I would never, EVER be caught short of a story.

那样子,我就会有一个不错的故事了.

Everything you read on here about my life. Whether good or bad. Enduring or embarrassing. Is me making good on that promise.

你在这里看到我的生活,好的或坏的.忍耐和尴尬的.都是我在对自己承诺的坚持.

The turning point of my life was to miss a party and become a storyteller.

那个转折点是我没去的聚会,然后成为了故事的讲述者.

And it’s something I wear on my skin every single day.

然后这就是我每天都肩负着的东西了.

Because if I ever have to watch my life flash before my eyes again…I promise you now, I will have a life story worth watching.

如果我再次经历跑马灯的时候,我答应你,我会有一个不错的故事值得你去看的.

And for those of you wondering what happened to the school hottie…

然后那些好奇那个漂亮的女孩子在后面发生了什么...

Well the universe has a way of bringing meaning to madness.

好吧,这个满是星光的宇宙会把可能延伸至无限.

She grew up to be an artist. And she’s the one who did this tattoo.

ta 之后成为了一个艺术家,然后我手上的这个纹身就是 ta 画的(shit,还是狗粮.)
