“Bill Gates recommends you read these 30 books.”

"比尔盖茨吐血推荐你去看这 30 本书."

“Steve Jobs attributes his success to how he takes a shit in the morning.”

"Steve jobs 把 ta 的成功归功于每天早上排放排泄物."

“I interviewed 1,000 millionaires, here's what they all have in common.”

"我采访过 1000 个百万富翁,这是 ta 们具有的共同点."

Dude, if success could be achieved by following Steve Jobs’ early morning poop routine, everyone would be successful.

姐们,如果通过一步一步执行 Steve jobs 早上的拉粑粑日期可以获得成功的话,每个人都成功了.

All of these college dropouts are geniuses and have the entrepreneurial spark. No amount of reading or clicking on shitty links will make you as successful as them.

这些退学都是天才(天才和退学是没有关联的)然后还有商业头脑.而不是看多少书,点击了多少鸡汤连接就可以让你像 ta 们那样成功的.

I am tired of being shoved these crap articles into my face and my friends thinking they're hot shit because they read Freakonomics.

我尝试把这些垃圾都从我脸上甩下去,但是我的朋友看了一些江湖上流传的经济学偏方之后,觉得这些玩意是一坨暖心的玩意.

That's not how life works people.

生活不是那样子的.

## 什么东西,你知道太迟了?

My dad raised my sister and I after our mother passed away in an accident when I was 6 and she was 8. Dad never spoke very much unless you asked him a question. He did not date he just went to work and came home and took care of us. I know my dad loved us and he always smiled but getting him to talk was like pulling teeth.

我爸在我姐 8 岁,我 6 岁的时候,我们的母亲因为意外去世后抚养我们长大.我爸除了你问 ta 问题之外,很少出声了.ta 没有再去和别的人约会,就去上班下班,然后就回家照顾我们了.我知道我爸是爱我们的,ta 喜欢笑,但是让 ta 说话就像拔掉 ta 的牙一样.

In HS I was a linebacker at our little HS and dad never missed a game. My sister played the flute in school and he went to all her concerts. All the other kids had outgoing parents and my dad was 5:10 140 pounds of quiet average and I used to really envy the laughter and camraderie the other guys had with their dads and mine was just smiling and so silent.

在我们的小高中,我打橄榄球的分卫,我爸每一场比赛都来看了.我姐在学校里面吹长笛,ta 也去了每一次我姐的音乐会.其他小屁孩的父母都很外向的样子(当然,不外向,你还能看到?),但是我爸才 160cm 65kg 左右的沉默的人,我过去总是很羡慕那些和 ta 们父母一起笑,得到称赞的小屁孩,而我爸就只会沉默的笑着.

On weekends he went fishing and took us with him if we wanted to go. We were always welcome and though I know he loved us he never had anything to say. Trying to talk to dad was just a lot of 1–2 word answers and then “glad we had this talk son.”

在星期的时候,ta 喜欢去钓鱼,如果我们想去的话,ta 会带上我们.ta 一直想我们陪伴在左右,所以我觉得 ta 是爱我们的只是没说出来而已.你尝试和 ta 交谈的时候,ta 给出一两个答案之后,就会进入标准回答"和你交谈很开心呀"

After college I moved away to Nashville about 4 hours from dad and then after a number of years he was in his 70s and got sick and passed away. At the funeral there were few people in attendance just some guys from his work, my sister and I and our families and an Army General in full uniform who formerly saluted my father and then sat in the back and said some prayers and got up to leave.

在大学后,我搬到离 ta 有四个小时远的 Nashville 那边,在多年以后,ta 在 70 岁的时候因病去世了.在 ta 的葬礼上面,只有 ta 一起工作的一些人参加,我和我姐还有我们的家庭,然后还有一个一身军装的将军在那里称赞我爸,然后就坐在后面,说了一些祈祷的话,然后就想起身离开了.

At the door I introduced myself and asked him if he knew my dad? He said that he had been a Captain in France and your dad was my specialty sergeant and he stopped a German advance in its tracks and destroyed 2 gun emplacements and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. We lost 8 men that day but 25 of us survived that day because your dad was the bravest SOB I ever saw or knew.

在门口的地方,我向将军介绍了我自己,然后问将军是不是认识我爸? 他说他在法国的时候是一个队长,而我爸是他的最特别的一个士兵,我爸曾击退德国人的进攻,然后还摧毁了 2 个炮位得到了勋章.我们那次战斗损失了 8 个人,但是因为你父亲的英勇,我们 25 个人存活了下来.

Needless to say I was in shock. In a shoebox at home buried in a closet was the medal of honor and the duplicate they give you for ceremonies, the rosette, the citation signed by Truman in 1945, a silver star and the croix de guerre with palm from France.

不用说我多吃惊了.在家里面藏在衣柜的一个鞋盒里面,我发现了那些勋章.那里面有杜鲁门在 1945 年签署的"玫瑰花环","银星勋章"和"法国棕榈勋章".

God I wish I could have heard all this from Dad. Does he know how proud I am of him?

要是我能听到 ta 自己说这些就好了. ta 知道我对 ta 有多骄傲吗?
