“Bill Gates recommends you read these 30 books.”

"比尔盖茨吐血推荐你去看这 30 本书."

“Steve Jobs attributes his success to how he takes a shit in the morning.”

"Steve jobs 把 ta 的成功归功于每天早上排放排泄物."

“I interviewed 1,000 millionaires, here's what they all have in common.”

"我采访过 1000 个百万富翁,这是 ta 们具有的共同点."

Dude, if success could be achieved by following Steve Jobs’ early morning poop routine, everyone would be successful.

姐们,如果通过一步一步执行 Steve jobs 早上的拉粑粑日期可以获得成功的话,每个人都成功了.

All of these college dropouts are geniuses and have the entrepreneurial spark. No amount of reading or clicking on shitty links will make you as successful as them.

这些退学都是天才(天才和退学是没有关联的)然后还有商业头脑.而不是看多少书,点击了多少鸡汤连接就可以让你像 ta 们那样成功的.

I am tired of being shoved these crap articles into my face and my friends thinking they're hot shit because they read Freakonomics.

我尝试把这些垃圾都从我脸上甩下去,但是我的朋友看了一些江湖上流传的经济学偏方之后,觉得这些玩意是一坨暖心的玩意.

That's not how life works people.

生活不是那样子的.

## 什么东西,你知道太迟了?

My dad raised my sister and I after our mother passed away in an accident when I was 6 and she was 8. Dad never spoke very much unless you asked him a question. He did not date he just went to work and came home and took care of us. I know my dad loved us and he always smiled but getting him to talk was like pulling teeth.

我爸在我姐 8 岁,我 6 岁的时候,我们的母亲因为意外去世后抚养我们长大.我爸除了你问 ta 问题之外,很少出声了.ta 没有再去和别的人约会,就去上班下班,然后就回家照顾我们了.我知道我爸是爱我们的,ta 喜欢笑,但是让 ta 说话就像拔掉 ta 的牙一样.

In HS I was a linebacker at our little HS and dad never missed a game. My sister played the flute in school and he went to all her concerts. All the other kids had outgoing parents and my dad was 5:10 140 pounds of quiet average and I used to really envy the laughter and camraderie the other guys had with their dads and mine was just smiling and so silent.

在我们的小高中,我打橄榄球的分卫,我爸每一场比赛都来看了.我姐在学校里面吹长笛,ta 也去了每一次我姐的音乐会.其他小屁孩的父母都很外向的样子(当然,不外向,你还能看到?),但是我爸才 160cm 65kg 左右的沉默的人,我过去总是很羡慕那些和 ta 们父母一起笑,得到称赞的小屁孩,而我爸就只会沉默的笑着.

On weekends he went fishing and took us with him if we wanted to go. We were always welcome and though I know he loved us he never had anything to say. Trying to talk to dad was just a lot of 1–2 word answers and then “glad we had this talk son.”

在星期的时候,ta 喜欢去钓鱼,如果我们想去的话,ta 会带上我们.ta 一直想我们陪伴在左右,所以我觉得 ta 是爱我们的只是没说出来而已.你尝试和 ta 交谈的时候,ta 给出一两个答案之后,就会进入标准回答"和你交谈很开心呀"

After college I moved away to Nashville about 4 hours from dad and then after a number of years he was in his 70s and got sick and passed away. At the funeral there were few people in attendance just some guys from his work, my sister and I and our families and an Army General in full uniform who formerly saluted my father and then sat in the back and said some prayers and got up to leave.

在大学后,我搬到离 ta 有四个小时远的 Nashville 那边,在多年以后,ta 在 70 岁的时候因病去世了.在 ta 的葬礼上面,只有 ta 一起工作的一些人参加,我和我姐还有我们的家庭,然后还有一个一身军装的将军在那里称赞我爸,然后就坐在后面,说了一些祈祷的话,然后就想起身离开了.

At the door I introduced myself and asked him if he knew my dad? He said that he had been a Captain in France and your dad was my specialty sergeant and he stopped a German advance in its tracks and destroyed 2 gun emplacements and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. We lost 8 men that day but 25 of us survived that day because your dad was the bravest SOB I ever saw or knew.

在门口的地方,我向将军介绍了我自己,然后问将军是不是认识我爸? 他说他在法国的时候是一个队长,而我爸是他的最特别的一个士兵,我爸曾击退德国人的进攻,然后还摧毁了 2 个炮位得到了勋章.我们那次战斗损失了 8 个人,但是因为你父亲的英勇,我们 25 个人存活了下来.

Needless to say I was in shock. In a shoebox at home buried in a closet was the medal of honor and the duplicate they give you for ceremonies, the rosette, the citation signed by Truman in 1945, a silver star and the croix de guerre with palm from France.

不用说我多吃惊了.在家里面藏在衣柜的一个鞋盒里面,我发现了那些勋章.那里面有杜鲁门在 1945 年签署的"玫瑰花环","银星勋章"和"法国棕榈勋章".

God I wish I could have heard all this from Dad. Does he know how proud I am of him?

要是我能听到 ta 自己说这些就好了. ta 知道我对 ta 有多骄傲吗?

## 当你伴侣脱掉衣服的时候,你觉得什么恶心到你了?

From:&nbsp;[What's the most disgusting thing you've found when your partner took off their clothes?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-disgusting-thing-youve-found-when-your-partner-took-off-their-clothes/answer/Haida-Kato)

I met this girl not too long ago; she was very pretty and from Japan like yours truly, so I decided to help her around town.

在不久前,我碰到了这个女孩子.ta 很漂亮,来自日本,就像你想的那样子,所以我决定去帮助熟悉这个镇子.

Something a little strange about her that I didn’t pay much attention to was that she always wore long-sleeved turtlenecks, or anything that would cover her neck and arms.

关于 ta 有一点奇怪的是,之前我没留意到 ta 一直穿着长袖高圆领的衣服,或者其他能遮住 ta 脖子和手臂的东西.

I knew she grew a liking to me, with me being a little dismissive at first, because the “How could anyone love me?” mentality. I slowly warmed up and we started being flirty.

我知道 ta 对我的好感日益剧增,刚开始我很不理解,因为我的"怎么可能会有人喜欢我?"的人设.后面,我开始膨胀了,和 ta 相互撩骚.

After a while, we went on our first date.

一段日子过后,我们去了我们的第一次约会.

A cafe, one of those millennial trend types of places.

咖啡店,在一个比较潮流的地方里面.

She showed up and said hi nervously, and we sat down at a table near a window. While we were talking, I noticed she tapped the table with her fingers, and whenever we would stop talking she would look out the window and just stare at the people walking by. Sometimes adjusting her turtleneck’s collar and sleeves up.

ta 来到的时候很紧张的打了一下招呼,然后我们坐在一张靠着窗口的桌子前.在我们说话那会,我注意到 ta 喜欢用手指敲到桌面,不论什么停掉交谈的时候,ta 总是盯着窗外,看人来人往.有些时候 ta 就整理一下 ta 的长袖和衣服.

She was anxious. Understandable, I sometimes look a little bit intimidating because I have a natural cold stare and I like wearing leather jackets.

ta 很紧张.可以理解,我有时看起来比较吓人,因为我喜欢冷冷的盯着别人,而且喜欢穿皮革外套.

When I went to get the coffee, I came back with a cookie as well. She laughed because it seemed so weird from the way I looked.

当我去拿咖啡回来的时候,我还拿了一点饼干.ta 笑了,因为我那天看起来挺奇怪的.

It went really well. We went on a few more dates, each time she got more and more nervous. I assumed it was because she was an anxious person, I didn’t pressure her - it seemed like a difficult topic.

看起来都很好的样子.我们又约会多了几次,每一次 ta 都更紧张了.我只是觉得 ta 是一个比较不安的人,我没去问 ta-这看起来很难开口.

Then we went and hung out in each other’s apartments.

然后我们都去对方的公寓逛啦.

After a few weeks of dating, she said in a sad tone, “This is the longest I have ever dated someone.”

在几个星期的约会之后,ta 忧伤的说,"这是我人生中最长的一次约会了."

I asked why, and she said that she was dreading this day.

我问为什么,ta 说 ta 这些天都快紧张到崩溃了.

She uncovered her arms and neck, revealing burn scars — it looked like snakes made of fire coiled around her arms and neck. The rest of her body also had this bizarre coil.

ta 把长袖拿掉露出手臂和脖子,展露那些疤痕-看起来就像被油炸过的蛇缠绕在 ta 的手臂和脖子上面.ta 身体上的其他部分也有着其他伤痕.

This is why she was so anxious, why she wears long sleeves.

这就是 ta 为什么紧张,为什么穿长袖的原因了.

And you know what I did?

你知道我做了什么吗?

I hugged her.

我抱了 ta 一下.

The most disgusting thing about this is not her scars, it’s that she has to hide them, to keep people from judging and staring.

最恶心我的不是 ta 的疤痕,而是 ta 必须要去隐藏那些疤痕,才能远离那些碎嘴的人.

That, is what I found most disgusting.

这就是我发现最恶心的事了.

Follow-up: I am still dating her - I swear she’s my soul-mate, and I wouldn’t have her any other way.

更新: 我们还在一起呀,我知道 ta 是我的另一半,而且我不能失去 ta.

I didn’t think it would explode like this. I appreciate all the stories and praise from all of you, and I hope all of you have fantastic lives.

我不知道会有这么多点赞.我感谢你们所有的故事和赞扬,希望你们也有一个精彩的人生.

From:&nbsp;[Ladies: what is one thing you want to tell your significant other but just can't?](https://www.quora.com/Ladies-what-is-one-thing-you-want-to-tell-your-significant-other-but-just-cant/answers/114801157)

I spend a lot of money on you. I hope you never find out how much.

我在你身上花了超多的钱.我希望你永远不知道是多少.

Sometimes I think about how interwoven our lives have become and it makes my heart swell. Other times it makes me want to vomit from fear.

有些时候,我想起我们共同虐狗的生活有多么好的时候让我有点小膨胀.但其他时间我很害怕,都几乎要吐了.

If I decline sex, it’s usually because I’m not feeling great about my body that day, not because I don’t want to have sex with you.

如果我不想 sex 的话,通常是因为那天我自己身体不舒服,不是因为我不想和你 have sex.

I love you. I do. But some days, I feel so unappreciated that I question whether I’m stupid for doing so.

我喜欢你,我真的喜欢你.但有些日子,我很恼怒我自己在做的一些事情.

I clean your room while you’re out. I wash the dishes. I have washed your car. I don’t do it for you, I do it for me.

在你外出的时候,我打理房子.清洗盘子.我还清洗你的车.我不是为了你而做的,而是为了我自己.

Yes, a lot of people pursue me. No, it doesn’t matter because I only have eyes for you.

是的,有很多人想追我.但没关系呀,我眼里只有你.

You are an adorable drunk. But please stop telling everyone how much you love the taste of my vagina.

I know you love me. But sometimes I get insecure and verbal reassurance would be nice.

我知道你喜欢我.但一些时候我很不安,安慰一下就很好了.

I changed my entire diet and quit smoking and drinking to make oral more enjoyable for you.

Don’t buy me expensive shit. Surprise me with things I’ve casually mentioned. Thoughtful stuff. Inside jokes. Make it personal.

不要给我买贵的玩意.能在我提起的东西给我一点惊奇就好.想法啦,笑话啦.做得更个人一点就好.

If we have an inside joke about cacti, get me one. I’ll appreciate it more than some overpriced dinner.

如果我们有一个关于仙人掌的笑话,给我说呀.这比去吃顿贵的东西更让我感激.

I do notice when you don’t brush your teeth. I just pretend not to. I choose to kiss you anyway. Afterwards I brush my teeth, floss, and rinse.

我的确知道你有没有刷牙.我只是假装不知道而已.不论怎样我选择吻你.在之后,我会刷我自己的牙,清理一下.

I love you. Way more than you know. Please stay.

我喜欢你,比你想的更喜欢.请,留下来.

## 作为纹身手艺人,什么让你哭成狗?

From:&nbsp;[As a tattoo artist, what is the saddest meaning behind a tattoo that you’ve heard?](https://www.quora.com/As-a-tattoo-artist-what-is-the-saddest-meaning-behind-a-tattoo-that-you-ve-heard/answers/114620027)

Date: January 03 2019

Oh god I'm going to cry writing this one. Okay. Here we go.

窝草,我会哭着写完这个故事的.好吧,我们现在开始准备好纸巾.

A kid comes in, well not really a kid but not an adult for sure. He was 22 if I remember. He hands me a letter, sealed in an envelope and everything. He never said a word, just standing there alittle nervous. I'm a female artist with the biggest shop in my area, I'm fairly well known and at first I thought, “Oh here we go, some shitty love letter.” I know that sounds cringey but I have honestly had men try to propose a date to me during a session, one guy pulled his member out and asked me if I was impressed, not because I'm some irresistible vixen but because I'm a heavily tattooed woman and some mean like that.

一个小屁孩走进店里面,也不算是小屁孩,当然也不算是大人的那种小屁孩.那会 ta 才 22 岁.ta 递给我一封信,和其他东西密封在一个信封里面.ta 没有说话,站在那里有点小紧张.我是一个在我们那个地区算是杠把子类型的纹身店的女老板了,在我的第一想法里,"窝草,又来了,又是一些恶心人的情书."我知道这听起来有点自恋,但我必须说,那时候还是有男的想追我的,一个男的把 ta 的小伙伴拿出来,问我是不是印象深刻,不是因为我有多大的魅力什么的,而是因为我是一个会纹身的女孩子,而一些男的就喜欢这口.(这样子翻译,求饶命)

I give him a raised brow and open the letter, it was just a small circle with a crude dotted line and X drawn inside it, kind of like a tiny treasure map.

我给 ta 翻了一个 45 度的白眼,然后打开那封信,那里面就只有一个小圆圈,一个有油迹的圆心,还有一个 x 画在里边,就像一个小小的藏宝图.

“Is this what you want today?”

"这是你今天想纹的吗?"

“Yes ma’am.”

"是的,大人"

“Alright, well let me go sketch something up and we’ll talk prices.”

"了解,先让我素描一下,然后我们再谈一下价格."

“Sure, but can you please make it as accurate to that as possible?”

"好的,能否请你画得尽你所能的精确?"

“Yea, I can. It still has to be drawn up so I can put on the stencil.”

"好的,我会的.就算这样子我还是要先画下来,然后才能纹."

“Alright, thank you.”

"了解,谢谢."

Blah blah blah, stencil and prices out of the way, now I'm sitting here tattooing it on his leg.

Blah blah blash,模板和价格都弄好了,现在我坐在那里,在 ta 的脚上纹上这个纹身.

“So is this something you drew?”

"这个是你自己画的东西吗?"

“My dad drew it.”

"我爸画的."

“Okay.” That was that. That's all he said. About 15 minutes later, I notice his leg is quivering.

"好吧."就这样.这就是 ta 说的了.在 15 分钟后,我察觉到 ta 的腿在颤抖.

“Hey are you okay? Your legs sha-” I look up and this kid has big fat tears rolling down his cheeks. His whole body is vibrating as he sniffles and tries to sob, I mean sob, silently.

"喂,你还好吧?你的腿在抖.." 我看向这个小屁孩的时候,我看见 ta 的眼泪都掉到脸颊了.ta 的整个身体因为抽泣而颤抖,而且 ta 还在克制着自己低声的哭泣,我是说那种无声的哭泣.

“Are you okay? Do we need to stop? Do you need some water?”

"你还好吧?我们需要停下来吗?你要不要喝点热水?"

“No, no its okay. I'm sorry, I'll try and hold still.”

"不需要,还好.不好意思呀,我会努力保持不动的."

My mommy instincts kick in, this kid is in pain.

看到这个小屁孩待在痛苦里面,我母爱泛滥了.

“Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?” I take off my glove and reach for his hand. Usually I would find this inappropriate at the work place, I would either call off the session and ask him to come back another day or try and carry on without prying but he looked so... Gone? Like his mind was wondering and wherever it was going was killing him emotionally.

"Hey,出什么事了吗?你还好吧?" 我把手套摘下,握住 ta 的手.通常我觉得这样在在工作的地方很不合适,我一般会取消这次的纹身而叫 ta 其他时间再来,然后继续其他业务而不刺探任何的东西,但 ta 看起来太...失落?就像 ta 很惊奇,但是现在发生的东西正在把 ta 的情感给绞杀掉.

He exploded.

ta 被拆碎了.

“Every year for my birthday my dad would draw me a treasure map to a special gift he got me. That was the best day of every year for me, getting that map and going out looking for my gift. It was always in a new place, the map was always exciting, he would take hours in his study drawing me these little maps so I'd have a great adventure on my birthday. Last year he got in an accident and sustained severe trauma, he made it by the grace of god but the doctors said the damage to his body was horrific at best and he'd have alot of complications and revision surgeries. He couldn't talk and could only barely write to tell us what he needed. This is the last map he drew for me on my birthday before he passed away a few days later. I don't know what its supposed to lead to, I never got a chance to ask him. One day I think I'll find out what that map leads to.”

"每一年,我爸会把我的生日礼物藏起来,然后画一张藏宝图给我.对我来说,那是一年中最好的一天呀.拿到藏宝图,然后去找生日礼物.那些礼物总是在新的地方,藏宝图总是让人很激动,我爸会花上一个多小时去画出这个藏宝图给我,好让我在生日那一天可以有一个惊奇的探险.上一年,我爸遇到了意外,有几次很严重的创伤,我爸好不容易撑过来了.医生说 ta 身体的创伤很严重,ta 还要经过很多的手术和康复治疗.ta 甚至不能说话,只能吃力的画下来告诉我们 ta 需要什么.这就是最后一张藏宝图了,在 ta 去世的前几天给我画好的.我不知道这藏宝图会带我去什么地方,我连问 ta 的机会都没了.在某一天,我想,我会知道这张地图会带我去哪里的."

This kid got the last map his dad ever drew for him permanently on his body.

这个小屁孩把 ta 爸曾经画给 ta 的地图纹在自己的身上了.

When I say I cried, I mean I CRIED. I went home and bawled to my husband. I don't know what that map was supposed to lead to but I know that kid will figure it out one day. I don't know his dads name, but whoever he is, rest in peace. You were so loved and so missed. I can see, just from talking to your son, you were the best dad in the world. You really were.

在我说我哭的时候,我是说我真的哭了.我回到家在我丈夫面前哭得一塌糊涂.我不知道那张地图会指向哪里,但我知道那个小屁孩一定会找到的.我不知道 ta 父亲的名字,甚至连 ta 是谁都不清楚,RIP.你被深爱和被深深的怀念着.我可以看出来,在和你的小屁孩的交谈的时候,你是这个世界上最好的父亲了.你真的是.
