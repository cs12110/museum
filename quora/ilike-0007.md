“Bill Gates recommends you read these 30 books.”

"比尔盖茨吐血推荐你去看这 30 本书."

“Steve Jobs attributes his success to how he takes a shit in the morning.”

"Steve jobs 把 ta 的成功归功于每天早上排放排泄物."

“I interviewed 1,000 millionaires, here's what they all have in common.”

"我采访过 1000 个百万富翁,这是 ta 们具有的共同点."

Dude, if success could be achieved by following Steve Jobs’ early morning poop routine, everyone would be successful.

姐们,如果通过一步一步执行 Steve jobs 早上的拉粑粑日期可以获得成功的话,每个人都成功了.

All of these college dropouts are geniuses and have the entrepreneurial spark. No amount of reading or clicking on shitty links will make you as successful as them.

这些退学都是天才(天才和退学是没有关联的)然后还有商业头脑.而不是看多少书,点击了多少鸡汤连接就可以让你像 ta 们那样成功的.

I am tired of being shoved these crap articles into my face and my friends thinking they're hot shit because they read Freakonomics.

我尝试把这些垃圾都从我脸上甩下去,但是我的朋友看了一些江湖上流传的经济学偏方之后,觉得这些玩意是一坨暖心的玩意.

That's not how life works people.

生活不是那样子的.
