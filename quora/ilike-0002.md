## 永远不要对程序猿说什么?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[How do I deal with ....?](What should you never say to a programmer?)

Date: November 22 2017

“I have a great idea for a startup! So we should make an app that…

<insert an idea here which is already on the market/impossible to implement/really stupid/useful for only 14 people around the world>
What do you think? Totally awesome right? So anyway, I am looking for a coder who will do the programming, shouldn’t take much time. I will be the CEO, doing the hard work, you know, talking with real people, you nerds can’t do that. How about we split the profit 80%–20%? I think it is generous!”

> "关于起步项目,我有一个很好的主意.我们应该弄一个 app...

> <这里面就是那个主意在 app 商店里面已经存在了/不可能去扩展的/蠢到爆炸的/全球可能只有 14 个人会使用的>你觉得怎么样?是不是很牛掰,很厉害? 所以,我在找一个能编程,而又不在开发中耗费很多时间的程序猿.我会成为 CEO,做最艰难的工作,你知道的,和那些客户交流,你们这些死宅是做不来的.不如我们 8/2 分成,我 8,你 2?我想这是极好的!"

We hate that. And guess what, we can talk to people, we just don’t like to :D

> 程序猿痛恨这个.你知道吗?我们可以和客户交流,只是不喜欢那样子做而已.

## 有哪一时刻发生在你生活中你觉得只会发生在电影里面的场景?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is one moment in your life you thought could only happen in a movie?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-moment-in-your-life-you-thought-could-only-happen-in-a-movie/answers/67374227?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 25 2017

I was in the midst of an extremely stressful year, sudden unexpected job loss, deaths in the family, life was just a big meteor plowing me into oblivion.

> 我当时处于压力非常大的一年之中.意外的失去工作,家庭成员逝世,生活就像一颗流星把我摧毁堙没.

I did my best to keep my chin up and try and be the strong one. I filled out job applications, comforted family, and tried to get back to living again. But, I wasn't eating, couldn't sleep. Just a total mess. I kept reassuring myself that it would pass. Each night that thought would shut my mind off at night enough to pass out in a pool of emotional exhaustion. Until that one crazy night..

> 我尽我最大的努力去面对困难(chin up==face up?),尝试去变得坚强一点.我填写了工作申请,安抚家庭,然后想回到正常生活里面.但,我吃不下,睡不着.心绪乱成一团.我继续安慰我自己说这些都会过去的.每一晚这种想法都会阻塞我的内心,让我精疲力尽.直到那一个不寻常的夜晚...

I woke up the next afternoon in the hospital and had no clue why I was there. A strange man was sitting in a chair by my feet. As my eyes opened, he walked into the hallway to get the attention of a nurse. She asked if I was feeling alright. I nodded with a foggy head. She said she would be back in a minute before disappearing.

> 第二天下午,我在医院醒来,我不知道会在医院里面,一点线索也没有.一个陌生的男人坐在我脚边的凳子上面.在我睁开眼睛的时候,他走到走廊去叫护士.护士问我是否还好.我脑子一片糊涂的点了点头.她说她一会再回来.

I looked around and asked the man sitting there if I knew him from somewhere. He only said that we had met the previous night. And then I suddenly realized I could not remember anything at all.

> 我望向四周,问那个男人是不是我在哪里认识他(500 年前是一家?).他仅仅说我们在昨晚才遇见的.然后,我意识到我不记得关于昨晚的任何事情了.

While trying to put the pieces together, the nurse walked in with another man. A psychiatrist.

> 当我尝试整理思绪的时候,那个护士带着另一个男的进来了,一个精神科医生.

To make a long story short, although I have no recollection of the journey, I had walked in my sleep to the roof of the hospital parking garage about a half mile away. Sound asleep. As I was walking along a knee high railing 6 stories above nothing but concrete, the security guard now sitting at my feet was doing a random check of the lot and pulled me off the edge.

> 简而言之,尽管我回忆不起那晚经历了什么,我梦游走到半里外的医院的停车场的屋顶.听起来是睡着了.当我走在膝盖高毫无保护的混凝土栏杆上的时候,现在坐在我脚边的那个安保人员正在随机巡逻,然后把我拉下来了.

A complete stranger saved my life, and then sat there for 15 hours just to be the one to welcome me back to the land of the living.

> 一个陌生人救了我,然后他坐在那里 15 个小时,就为了成为欢迎我回归生活的一员.

A week in the hospital, some much needed temporary medication, extensive stress management and grief therapy. I am whole again and doing well.

> 入院一周后,需要一些暂时的药物治疗,压力管控和痛苦治疗.我恢复了而且恢复得还不错.

That was 12 years ago. Every few months I bring security guard Ted a cup of coffee and sit on the roof of that same garage (it is now fenced in) to share a couple doughnuts and a brief conversation of gratitude. He is the most humble, kind-hearted person I have ever met.

> 那是 12 年前.每隔几个月,我都会给保安 Ted 一杯咖啡,坐在同一个车库的屋顶上(现在建立了围墙)去分析一些糕点和一会怀着感激之情的交谈.Ted 是我见过最谦虚,最热心的人了.

If you are reading this, thanks Ted. Thank you for my life.

> 如果你看见这个,谢谢你 Ted.谢谢你为我做的一切.

P.S. We both know I owe you so much more than coffee and a snack, but you just have be stubborn about it!

> Ps 我们都知道我欠你远不止一杯咖啡和小吃,但你坚持你只要这些.

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What will always be cool?](https://www.quora.com/What-will-always-be-cool/answer/Sean-Kernan?srid=uv7Kg)

Someone just stumbles across you being a concert pianist or artist. Or catches you singing by yourself.

> 一些人会为你是一个艺术家或钢琴家而倾倒.或者在你自己给自己唱歌的时候.

Or finds out you have a nice body when they take your clothes off. Not because you wear skin-tight clothes every day.

> 或者发现你当你不穿衣服的时候身材很好,而不是你每天都穿着紧身衣.(大雾)

Or that you went to Ivy League because someone else told them. Not because you announce it twice a day.

> 或者你去常青藤大学的事由别人告诉他们.而不是因为你每天公布两次.

Boom.

## 你今天读到最好的东西是什么?

From:  [What is the best thing you read today?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thing-you-read-today/answer/AnandBhushan-Singh?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 27 2017

A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much.

> 他娶了一个漂亮的女孩子围妻子.他非常爱她.

One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour.

> 一天她得了一种皮肤病.慢慢的,她开始失去她的容颜.这是都是在她丈夫出去旅行的那一天开始的.

While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually.

> 当他回来的时候,他遇到了一场意外,同时失去了他的视力.不论怎样,他们的婚姻得以和往常一样继续下去.伴随时光消逝,她逐渐失去她美丽的容颜.

Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life.

> 失去视力的丈夫不知道这个问题,然后妻子容貌的改变并没有让他们的婚姻有什么和之前不一样的.

He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him great sorrow.

> 他们彼此深爱对方.一天,她逝世了.她的逝世给他带来了深深的悲伤.

He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you. He replied, I am not blind.

> 当他完成葬礼的最后一个仪式,他想要离开这个镇子.一个站在他背后的男人对他说,现在你还能自己一个人出外吗?之前都是你的妻子来帮助你的.他回答到,我不是盲人.

I was acting, because if she knew l could see her ugliness it would have pained her more than her disease. So I pretended to be blind.

> 我是扮的,因为如果她知道我可以看见她的不美丽的一面,这会给她比病更多的痛苦.所以我假装我是盲的.

She was a very good wife. I only wanted to keep her happy.

> 她是一个非常,非常,非常好的妻子.我只想让她幸福.

Moral: Some times it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings, in order to be happy. No matter how many times the teeth bite the tongue, they still stay together in one mouth. That's the spirit of FORGIVENESS.

> 寓意:某些时候,对于其他人的短处,我们装作看不见是对于彼此都好的一件事.不论牙齿把舌头咬了多少次,但它们一直都是待在一起的.这就是原谅的力量.(What,我的语文是体育老师教的,还是你的是?)

May God grant us all the spirit of forgiveness, unity and togetherness.

> 愿 Blabla 赐予我们所有关于原谅,团结和欢聚的力量.

## 收到过最好的礼物?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the best gift that somebody has ever received?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-gift-that-somebody-has-ever-received/answer/Kevin-Layton-2?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: November 28 2017

My Dad bought me a brand new Jeep Wrangler when I was 17, but the real gift was what he taught me about life by way of this car. Every month, on the first of the month, I was required to pay him 150 if I wanted to continue driving my Jeep. If I didn’t pay, I couldn’t drive my car (or “his car”, as he often reminded me, since he owned the title). My Dad was (and still is) a successful businessman, who makes a very decent living. To a 17-year old working part-time in High School, 150 was more than I usually had in my bank account, and I often struggled with the prospect of handing over 150 when the time came to pay the piper. Although it was often done begrudgingly and with much complaining, I always made sure to have 150 in his hand on the first of the month, and did so for 2 years.

> 在我 17 岁的时候,我爸给我买了一辆新的吉普车,但真正礼物是他通过这辆车教给我的东西.每一个月,在月初,如果我想要开那辆车,我就要被要求交 150 美元的费用.如果我不交,我不能驾驶那辆车(或者说是他的车,就像他经常提起的那样,从他拥有那车的归属权).我爸曾经是(现在也还是)一个成功的商人,有着十分得体的生活.对于一个 17 岁在高中里面兼职的人,150 美元通常比我在银行里面的存款还多,而我经常挣扎在把 150 美元交到他那里来换取一个月的驾驶权的场景.尽管这通常带来很多关于吝啬的埋怨.我得一直确保我有 150 美元在每个月的开始交给他,而且这样做了 2 年.

The day I graduated High School, my Dad pulled me into his office at our house, and sat me down for a little chat. “Kevin” he said, extending his arm to give me a white, sealed envelope, “here is your graduation present. Although to be fair, this is technically a present from yourself.” I opened the envelope with caution, and almost started crying when I realized he just gave me $3,600 in cash, or the equivalent of 24 car payments that he had been saving for the last 2 years. Every payment I gave him went straight into this envelope, to be opened upon my graduation. By forcing me to pay him every month, he was teaching me how to save, how to manage my money, how to find and hold a job, how to be responsible. My Dad is and will forever be the best man I have ever known.

> 当我高中毕业的那天,我爸把我拉到他在家中的办公室里面,然后坐下来交谈一会."Kevin",他说,把他的手伸过来递给我一个白色,密封的信封,"这个是你的毕业礼物.说句公道话,这个礼物实际是你自己送给你自己的."我小心的打开那个信封,我差点哭出来了,当我意识到他给我 3600 美元的现金的时候,或者等于他保存了 2 年,我 24 个月的车费.每一次我给他的钱,他都直接放到那个信封里面,为了在我毕业的时候才打开.为了强迫我每个月缴费,他是在教我怎么存钱,怎么去管理,怎么去找和保住一份工作,怎么承担责任.我爸是我认识中最好的男人.

Edit: He gave me the title for the Jeep 4 years later, as my college graduation present :)

> 更新:在四年后,他把那辆车的归属权给了我,在我大学毕业的时候

Edit #2: 20,000+ upvotes?! I’m humbled by the response and appreciate everyone’s kind words…thank you all!

> 更新 2: 20k+点赞?!我被你们的留言击败了,同时感谢你们每一位的热心留言.谢谢各位父老乡亲.

The best gift a parent can give their child is an email id.

On their 18th birthday, give them the email id and password. :)

> Sameer 在思绪中迷失了.他和 Meghna 疯狂的爱着彼此 9 年了.她一直在他身边陪他度过他生命中的起落.在他的失败和成功的时候,在黑暗的时候.是她,那个给了他新生的人.最爱他的人也是她.对于他来说,她是他的唯一.

## 怎么发现一个人是不是聪明?

From:  [How can people spot an intelligent person?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-people-spot-an-intelligent-person/answers/68070917?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: January 03 2018

There was this girl in my class (going anonymous cause she follows me on Quora) who was very intelligent.

> 我们班有这么一个女孩(匿名是因为她在 Quora 上关注了我),一个十分聪明的女孩子.

She was a social person and a mix between extravert and introvert.

> 她是一个喜欢社交的人,能在外向和内向的群体都混得开的人.

In physics, she would spot mistakes the teacher made and would fidget in her seat with a grin waiting for the teacher to finish and quietly ask a question to point out the mistake. She never directly said “Hey Mister, you made a mistake.” She would try as much as possible not to embarrass the teacher and it worked because often times she would ask a question to a teacher so he/she would notice his or her own mistake.

> 在物理课上,她能认出老师的错误,然后面带微笑不安的坐在座位上,等待老师完成之后,然后提出疑问去引出老师的错误.她从来不直接说"老师,你犯了一个错."她努力不让那个老师觉得尴尬,而这都行之有效,因为许多次她向老师提问问题后,老师们都意识到自己的错误了.

She had this charm to her. She knew a lot about a lot.

> 她很有魅力呀.她知道一堆的东西关于一堆东西(Harry Potter 里面的 Hermione,微笑)

At first sight she doesn't seem like the smart one. She can make everyone laugh and didn't really nerd out like the other smart kids.

> 对于她的第一印象,她看起来并不像聪明的人.她很幽默而且不像其他聪明的人一些宅.

One time, the class was discussing stuff and somehow came to the topic of the Center of North America. Everyone tried to guess and after everyone tried deducing she waited till everyone was quiet and said “Its a place in North Dakota called Rugby.” And proceeded to describe its origins of this place.

> 一次,班里面在讨论一些东西,不知道怎样就扯到了关于南美中部的话题.每一个人都努力的去尝试,她等所有人推断结束后,然后说:"这是一个叫 Rugby 在 North Dakota 的地方."然后开始描述这个地方的来源历史.

Like I said, she knew a lot about a lot.

> 就像我说的,我知道一堆的东西关于一堆的东西.

Killed her Science fair project and managed to take the laziest kids in the class and won first place in the school. I am telling you that those kids have never passed a singe test in any Science course.

> 放弃她自己的科研项目去帮助班里面最懒的小屁孩去赢得他们在学校的第一个奖励.我告诉你,那些小屁孩从没有通过一科科学的考试.

Every guy had a crush on her even though she was not as pretty as the other girls who got straight A’s. She was not a straight A student and got B’s and even C’s.

> 每个人对她都有心中的老狗砰砰乱撞的时候,即使她没有其他那些全优女孩子那么漂亮.她不是全优的学生,有时候会拿到 B,甚至是 C.

She says she hates English class but was one of the people who scored highest on state exams.

> 她说她不喜欢英语课却成为在洲测试里面拿最高分的人(死学霸,鉴定完毕)

All the girls were jealous of her. She didn't try to be smart like the others did . She had it in her already.

> 其他的女孩子全都妒忌她.她没尝试过去想其他人那么聪明.她已经很聪明了.

I loved coding and when we sat in class, she would see me code all the time. I had a problem with a program I was working on and she asked me if she could borrow the laptop. Fixed it in 5 minutes. That was the day i realized that she was proficient in 3 programming languages. She watched me code almost all the time and never bothered to tell me.

> 当我们坐在班级里面,我喜欢编程,她一直都在看我编程.有一个 bug 在我正在写的代码上,她问我可不可以借一下我的笔记本.然后 5 分钟就搞定了.就在那天,我知道她精通 3 门编程语言.她一直在看我编程而从来都没打搅我.(她&&编程==amazing)

I guess thats why everyone loved her.

> 我想这就是每个人都喜欢她吧.

You could tell when someone is intelligent just by the way he/she acts.

> 你可以通过那些人的行为来辨别他们是否聪明.

I pressed the button for floor number thirteen. The only other occupants of the lift were two cute girls, who were talking to each other in a highly fake American accent.

> 我按下去 13 楼的按钮.有两个可爱的女孩子和我在电梯里面,她们相互说着那种很假的美国口音.

At the fifth floor, the lift stopped, the door opened, and I was surprised to see an African man standing in front of us. True that Delhi is a favorite destination of international tourists, but people of African origin are still a rare sight.

> 在第五层,电梯停了,然后电梯门开了,我对一个非洲男人站在电梯门前感到惊讶.虽然新德里是国际旅客喜欢的旅游地点,但来自非洲的旅客还是很少见到的.

The lift was again on its way.

> 然后电梯继续上升.

I turned my attention back to the girls. Suddenly, one of them started signaling the other, making big round eyes, first pointing towards her, and then towards the African guy. For an instant, the second girl seemed confused, but then she realized what her friend was trying to point to and both of them burst with silent giggles. I felt really bad for the African guy, who seemed strangely calm. He didn’t seem to mind at all. Emboldened by this, the two girls began talking loudly, but this time, they strategically switched to Hindi.

> 我把注意力重新转到那两个女孩子身上.突然,其中一个女孩子给另一个女孩子信号,差不多翻白眼一样的滚动眼睛,望向她的朋友,然后望向那个非洲同胞.刚开始,另一个女孩子看起来有点疑惑,然后她明白指什么之后,她们两个爆发出一阵低沉的猪叫般的笑声.我为那个非洲同胞感到难过,但他看起来很冷静.他好像一点也不介意.在这个怂恿下,她们开始说得更大声了,但这之后的讨论,她们战略性的换成印度语了.

“Kitna bhadda lag raha hai ye kalua!” (He’s so ugly, this Blackie!)

> "Bla bla bla"(这个黑人,太丑了)

“Haan, sahi kaha. Baal dekh iske, jaise ghungrali ghas ugi ho sir pe.” (Yep, you’re right. Look at his hair. Looks like his head is covered with curly grass.)

> "Bla bla bla"(是呀,你是对的.看他的发型.就像他头上堆着一堆乱草.)

At this, both of them again started guffawing with tears in their eyes.

> 这时,她们两个开始笑得都掉眼泪了.

“Itni badsurat shakal kisi ki kese ho sakti hai!” (How can somebody have such an ugly face!)

> "Bla bla bla "(一个人怎么可以长这么丑!(Tips:那是因为你们没遇见我 笑))

I was really embarrassed. Was this my incredible India?

> 我十分尴尬.这还是我的大印度吗?(Absolutely)

The lift stopped. The African guy adjusted his backpack and proceeded to step out. Then suddenly, he turned around, and in impeccable Hindi, said -

> 电梯停了.非洲同胞调整了一下他的背包,然后走出电梯.忽然,他转过身来,用 24k 纯正印度语说:

“Badsurat dil hone se to badsurat shakal hona achha hai!” (It’s better to have an ugly face than an ugly heart!)

> "Bla bla bla"(面丑也比心丑好呀!!!)

And then, he was gone.

> 然后,他就没了.(叫你拽,敢顶地头蛇,问你死没?)

The expression of utter shame and embarrassment on the girls’ faces, turned red with rage and humiliation, is something I still cherish to this day.

Three encounters with one of my ex-classmates:

> 我一个前同学做了以下三件事:

I bought a new computer after a long wait. She came home to see it. And as I turned on the system, she immediately said, "Waste. It's pretty slow.

> 在等了很久之后,我买到了我的新电脑.她来到我的家看电脑.当我打开电脑系统的时候,她立刻说:"浪费钱,太慢了."

I said I'm gonna join for M.Tech, and she responded, "Now every fool does that".

> 我说我要加入 M.Tech,然后她回答,"现在做这个都很傻".

My teeth were misaligned and I wore braces for sometime to correct it. After a year, when the braces were taken off, she visited me, and her first response was, "12k just went in vain, you don't have any change."

> 我的牙齿不太整齐,所以我一段时间带着牙套来纠正它.一年后,当那个牙套拿掉的时候,她来拜访我,然后她的第一句回复就是,"12k 就那样子没了,看不出来你有任何变化."

Yes may be my brand new system was slow, may be MTech has become common is what she meant, may be there was no great change in me after braces. But when somebody invests on something, you cannot invalidate the whole purpose with statements like these.

> 是的,或许我新版本的系统很慢,或许 MTech 就像她说的那样变得平常,或许在摘掉牙套之后没有太大的改变.但当某些人投资一些东西的时候,你不能用这样的语气来使整一个目的都无效.

This is something I have never done. And this, I believe nobody should ever do. Stay positive, spread positivity !! :)

> 这是我之前没做过的事.而且我认为没人会这么做.保持乐观,散播正能量(If you mean the chickensoup, then I don't give fuck.)

Edit: This answer was in no way intended to demean my friend's character. I don't want to spread that message either. :)

Years ago, I was the Chief Customs Officer on duty at a major border crossing.

> 一年前,我还是一个在主要边境的海关官员.

This was post 9/11, and we were all still a little numb, anxious to somehow make a difference in the war on terrorism and to protect the homeland.

> 在 11 月 9 日的报道之后,我们有点麻木,着急着想在面对恐怖袭击的战争中做一些改变来保护国土.

One afternoon a man in his mid-fifties was crossing the border when his name alerted for possible ties to terrorism. The man was a naturalized U.S. citizen, having been born in a Middle-East country. During this time, our “system” was rife with false positives—folks that might have the same or similar name with a known terrorist or someone with ties to terrorism. Sometimes, they might even have the same birthday, and yet not be the suspect in question.

> 一天下午,一名 50 多岁的男子在通过边境的时候,他的名字显示他可能恐怖袭击组织有关.这个男人是一个移民到美国的公民,在中东的国家出生.在这段时间里,我们的系统充斥着虚假的假设——那些可能与已知恐怖分子或与恐怖主义有联系的人有着相同或相似名字的人.有时,他们甚至可能是同一天生日,但不是嫌疑犯.

Per our standard operating procedures (SOPs), this man was handcuffed, escorted into our secondary inspection area and subjected to a personal search.

> 按照我们的标准操作流程(SOPs),我们给他戴上了手铐,护送他到我们的第二个检查处并进行个人搜查.

Also per our SOPs, this individual was isolated for further questioning.

> 同时根据我们的标准流程,这个人会单独接受更多的审问.

Now, all of this was done without my personal knowledge. That’s the purpose of SOPs, so certain critical situations are all handled in a specific way, according to a specific standard, even when a supervisor is not on scene to direct operations.

> 现在,在我不知情的情况下,这些全都完成了.这就是 SOPs 的目的,因此,某些关键的情况都是以一种特定的方式来处理的,根据一个特定的标准，,使一个主管不在现场指挥操作.

However, that’s no excuse. I was in charge, and I was responsible for the treatment this individual received.

> 不论怎样,这里没有借口推脱.我正在掌管这里,而我得为这个人管理作出回应.

While walking through the station, I observed this man, sitting handcuffed in an isolated area, guarded by two armed officers and waiting for an officer with specialty training to question him regarding any possible ties to terrorism. This, in and of itself, was not particularly unusual. It was also a part of our SOPs.

> 当我走过警察站的时候,我观察那个男人,手铐锁着坐在单独的拘留室里面,被两个武装警察看管,等待着一名有专业训练的警官来询问他是否与恐怖主义有任何联系,这本身并不是特别不寻常.这也是我们 SOPs 的一部分.

What immediately struck me as unusual, however, was that this man was silently crying, tears flowing down his face. I stopped outside the isolation room and asked one of the officers to brief me on the situation, which he did.

> 是什么突然间要把我牵扯进去,不论怎样,那个男人还是在默默的流着泪,泪水划过他的脸庞.我站在拘留室的外边,询问其中一个警官向我简单介绍一下现在的情况,他做了什么.

I then entered the room and sat opposite the man. I asked him, “What’s wrong? Are you in pain?”

> 然后我走进那间房间,坐在那个男人的对面.我问他,"有什么问题吗?你是不是不舒服?"

“No,” he answered simply.

> "不是的,"他简洁的回答.

There was something about his demeanor, like he had been betrayed and injured in some way.

> 那些有一些关于他的举止神色的东西,就像他曾被背叛和伤害过.

I asked him, “Is there something you need? Something I can do for you?”

> 我问他,"你有什么需要的没?我有什么可以帮你的没?"

“My wallet,” he said. “Look in my wallet.”

> "我的钱包,"他说,"看一下我的钱包."

His wallet lay on the desk in front of me, the result of the officers’ emptying of his pockets as part of the search for weapons.

> 他的钱包摆放在我前面的桌子上,因为警察需要清空他的行李来检查是否携带有武器.

I opened his wallet and emptied the contents onto the desk. “There,” he nodded toward a folded newspaper article that had tumbled out of his wallet. “There, read the paper.”

> 我打开他的钱包,把里面所有的东西倒到桌子上."那里,"他指向从他钱包里面掉出来的那份折叠好的报纸."那,看那张报纸."

I unfolded a worn piece of newsprint. It was an article that told of a small-town young man who had enlisted in the U.S. Army, only 19 years old. He had been killed in the line of duty in Iraq just a few months earlier.

> 我打开那张报纸.那是一篇文章告诉一个来自小镇的年轻人应征入伍的消息,仅仅 19 岁.他几个月前在执勤的时候被伊斯兰恐怖组织杀害.

I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the young soldier’s last name was the same as that of the man who sat, handcuffed, in front of me.

> 我背后感到一股凉意,当我意识到那个年轻士兵的姓氏和正在坐在我前面,被手铐锁住,坐在我前面的男人的姓氏是一模一样的.

“That my son, that my son (sic),” he sobbed, as tears again flowed freely down his cheeks. “My son, he die for this country! HE DIE FOR THIS COUNTRY!” More sobs. “I … I love this country. I love my son … my son … my son.”

> "那个是我的孩子,我的孩子,"他抽泣着,眼泪在他的脸颊上横流."我的孩子,他为这个国家牺牲了.他为这个国家牺牲了."更大声的痛哭."我...我爱这个国家.我爱我的孩子,...我的孩子...,我的孩子"

I had been around. I had heard hundreds, maybe thousands of stories in my 30-plus years in Customs. Nothing had ever affected me in this way.

> 我一直都在海关这边.我听过数百上千的故事,在我过去的 30 多年的海关生涯里面.没有一个故事能像这个那样子影响我.

“Uncuff this man,” I instructed one of the officers. “But Chief,” he objected until I cut him off with a wave of my hand.

> "解开这个男人的手铐,"我指示其中的一个警官."但是长官,"他拒绝直到我用手势打断他的说话.

“Never mind,” I said. I told the silently crying man to stand and turn around so I could uncuff him.

> "不要介意",我对那个警官说.我告诉那个默默流泪的男人站起来,转身,那样子我就可以解开他的手铐了.

Afterward he just turned back around and sat back down on the hard back chair. He stared straight ahead, a blank expression on his face.

> 在他转身,重新坐回那张椅子的时候.他直视着前方,面无表情.

“I am sorry for your loss,” I told him. “I know that this means less than nothing to you now, but I am so sorry for your loss.”

> "我对你儿子的逝世感到遗憾,"我告诉他."我知道我的同情对比与你的失去,一点也没有用,但我真的对你的失去很遗憾."

He stared at me for a long moment, maybe twenty seconds. He reached out his hands towards me, and I grasped his forearms as he grasped mine. We sat and cried together, silently. The two officers looked on, clearly uncomfortable, unsure what to do.

> 他盯着我看了一会,或许有 20s.他把他的手伸向我,我拉住他的前臂,就像他拉住我的一样.我们站着哭了起来,沉默着.两个警官看着我们,十分不自然,又不知道能做什么.

It was 2007. I moved from Andhra Pradesh to Tamilnadu (Chennai) for job. I stayed in a ladies hostel with four of my roommates from my location. I did not know Tamil during that period. I was new to the language, culture and people. I was the kind of a girl who stays indoor, silent and reserved.

> 那是 2007 年的时候.我为了工作从 Andhra Pradesh 移居到 Tamilnadu(Chennai).我和四个来自我们那块地方的室友住在一间女士酒店里面.在那期间,我对 Tamil 一点也不了解.我也是刚接触那边的语言,文化和当地的人.我也是那种宅女,寡言高冷的那种.(牛逼咯,The Queen)

On Dec 31st, one of my roommates found a new hostel (due to some problems at old one) for us and she spoke to the new hostel warden (run by two ladies) and told us that we are leaving that evening to the new hostel. We were happy because we did not have to stay in the old hostel anymore .

> 在 12 月 31 的时候,我们的一个室友找到了一个新的酒店(应对在现在这个酒店里面存在的问题),她和新酒店的经营者(由两个女士经营),然后告诉我们傍晚搬到新酒店.我们很开心因为我们不用被逼的待在这个旧的酒店了.

In, the evening, we packed our luggage and booked two auto rickshaws and started to the new hostel. Before leaving, confidently, my roommate fought with the old hostel warden for not providing good facilities.

> 在傍晚的时候,我们收拾好我们的行李,预订了两台面包车(不管,你喜欢什么就叫什么吧)然后准备去新的酒店.在离开之前,我们迷之自信,我的舍友为酒店不提供好的设备和酒店管理员争吵.

I was happy that, the next day is new year and we have some good plans and vows to start the year. When we reached the new hostel, the lady my friend dealt with, was not there. She was out of town and the one who was there does not know anything about our visit. She told no vacancy. We were shocked and tried convincing her but of no help. As we are nearly freshers (new to job) with less money in hand, new place, new language… OMG…two of our friends started crying. Imagine us, on December 31st night (nearly at around 8PM), we were on the platform with our luggage.

> 我对这次争吵感到高兴(瓜子,西瓜都准备好了),然后第二天就是新年了,我们有一些很好的关于新年的计划.当我们到新酒店的时候,那个负责处理的朋友不在那里(被卖了吧).她已经不在这边了,然后酒店管理的人员完全不知道我们会来.她告诉我们没有空余的房间了.我们表示震惊然后尝试说服她给我们提供房间,但并没什么卵用.那会我们都是刚入职的手里没什么钱的菜鸟,新的地方,新的语言,....窝草,...我有两个朋友都已经泪流满面了.想象一下我们,在 12 月 31 日(差不多晚上 8 点),我们带着我们的行李在地铁站里面.

We were so panicked and looking for some help. The problem was, we never shared this to our parents yet, about the hostel change.

> 我们很恐慌,然后想寻求他人帮助.问题是,我们还没对我们的父母说过关于换酒店的事情.

Then, one of my colleagues saw us on the road and came. He asked about everything and offered us help. He took us to stay in his apartment, for that night. There were few others guys staying there along with him. With no other choice, we went in and stayed at that night. But, we were very uncomfortable there. That is a bachelor’s room (one like below).

> 然后,一个我们的同事看见我们在路上然后过来.他问我们有什么可以帮我们的没.为了应对那晚的情况,他把我们带到他们的公寓里面.那里还有少数的几个臭男人在和他在一起.没有其他的选项了,我们到他的公寓然后在那里度过今晚.但,我们觉得很不舒服.那是单身狗的房间呀.(该)

Most of us didn't sleep that night but to be frank, they were good and friendly. They offered us good food and shelter. They made us to stay as comfortable as possible. That night around 12AM, my parents, siblings and friends called me to wish “Happy New Year”. I was into tears on each call as I was hiding something from them. They do not know about this incident till now.

> 我们大多数都没能睡着,但实话说,他们真的是好人.他们给我们提供了好的食物和床单.他们让我们过得尽量舒服.那晚差不多 12 点的时候,我的父母和兄弟还有朋友打电话给我说"Happy new year".我每一个电话都含着泪水,在我还藏着这些事没让他们知道.他们直到现在也不知道那件事.

The next day, he (the person who offered stay), searched a ladies hostel for us and we moved to that place immediately. We thanked him from the heart.

> 第二天,他(那个为我们提供帮助的单身狗),找到一间女生酒店给我们,然后我们立刻搬了进去.我们打心底的感谢他.

The incident changed most of ours way of thinking. All guys are not bad :)

## 有哪些严重被低估的优点?

From:&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is the single most underrated trait a person can have?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-single-most-underrated-trait-a-person-can-have/answer/Haily-Cramer?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: January 10 2018

What did I realize was an underrated trait?

> 为什么我会认为那是一个被低估的特点?

I had to take one of the hardest undergraduate college courses at my university. This course had a higher rate of failing students than passing. Everyone said it was the professor's fault students would fail.

> 我在大学的时候,我上一门很难的课程.这门课程挂科的比通过的多得多.学生挂科,其他人都说是教授的错.

The first day, the professor warned our class of 300 students that this was not a course you could pass by studying the night before. I laughed and thought, “how ludicrous…” Every one of my teachers had said the exact same thing, and I would always ace the class.

> 那门课的第一节课,那个教授警告班里面的 300 多个学生,这不是一门你们考前前一晚复习就能通过的课程.我笑了,然后想了想,"扯淡吧..."每一个我的老师都说一样的东西,而我一直是班里面的学霸(这里要有掌声?)

I studied for the test the night before... and I failed it. I had never had this happen. I did the math, and came to the realization the best possible grade I could now receive in the class was a "C". I would not qualify for the competitive nursing program I wanted. I also did not have enough money to retake the course.

> 我在测试的前一晚才学习,然后我挂掉了.我之前从来没试过.我运算了那些算术,然后自我感觉我在班级里面可以得到最好的成绩,而现在我只得到了"C".我没有获得我想要的竞赛资格.同时,我也没钱去重修这门课.

I was mortified. I did not want to walk in front of my 300 classmates and have them see my professor sign my drop slip.

> 我很窘迫.我不想在 300 多个同学面前,给他们看见教授在我的签名栏签名.

I decided to email my professor:

> 所以我觉得给我教授发邮件:

You and I have never met. That is my fault... I wanted to tell you that I am dropping your course. It is my fault I am failing. Could we possibly meet in your office to have you sign my drop slip? I am really embarrassed. Things will be different the next time around. However, due to financial reasons, I won't be retaking this course until next year.

> 我们之前没单独会过面.这是我的错....我想告诉你我把你的课程挂掉了.我挂掉全是因为我的错.我们可以在你的办公室见面吗,让你在我的签名栏签名?真的好尴尬.第二轮会变得不一样的了.不论怎样,因为经济原因,我只能在明年才能再次选修这门课程.

He replied, and told me to talk to him after class. Thinking nothing of it, I waited until my peers left and approached him with my slip.

> 他回复了,然后告诉我在下课之后去和他谈话.我对此毫无想法,我等着,直到我的同学离开,然后带着我的签名纸去找他.

Professor: "Are you Haily?"

> 教授:"你是 Haily?"

Me: "I am. Here is my drop-slip."

> 我:"是的.这个是我的签名纸."

Professor: "Your email was a breath of fresh air. Do you know how many times the students blame me for failing my course even though I tell them exactly what they need to do to pass? I'm going to sign an incomplete slip, instead. This will allow you to retake the class next semester at no charge. However, you have to read the book and attend every one of the class study sessions... and don’t just study the night before. Please, don't make me regret my decision."

> 教授:"你的邮件就像一口新鲜的空气.你知道多少次那些学生因为自己挂科责怪我,即使我告诉他们需要怎么去做才能通过考试?我会签你一张没完成的签名,来代替你挂科的签名.这会允许你在下学期重新学这门课.不论怎样,你一定要去看那些书,然后参加每一节课.然后不要以为在考前复习就可以了.不要让我为自己的决定后悔."

I was flabbergasted. I did not deserve what he did. This experience helped me form study habits to be successful in college. With hard work, I did eventually ace the class.

> 我目瞪狗呆.我配不上他为我所做的.这次经历帮我帮我养成了在大学成功的学习习惯.在努力学习下,我最终在班里面拿到了 A.

What I realized was an underrated trait: the ability to apologize and admit you are wrong.

> 我意识到一个被低估的特点: 去道歉的能力和承认你自己是错的.

This experience was extremely humbling. I am prideful, and I'm awful at apologizing.

> 这个经历是十分羞辱人的.我很骄傲,同时我不太会道歉.

I highly respect individuals who are able to apologize. It is hard for any person to admit their faults.

> 我很尊敬那么能自动去道歉的人.这对每个来说,承认自己的错都是很难的.

It's a trait that is extremely underrated; instead of making a person look weak, it shows tact and strength.

> 这个优点是被严重低估的.看起来一个人示弱,这是聪明和力量的展现.

I am a 13-year-old boy raised by modern feminists. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom and sister.

I wish I had good things to say about my childhood. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

> 我希望我说一些关于童年好的回忆.不幸的是,事实并不是这样.

The other day, my sister asked my mother what she would do If she told her she kissed a boy.

> 有一天,我的妹妹问我妈如果她在学校吻了一个小屁孩,她(我妈)会怎么做.

This question was asked merely out of curiosity.

> 这个问题只是出于好奇.

My mother told her she would sit down and talk with her. She wouldn’t be angry or yell, but they would discuss consequences.

> 我觉得愤怒,而且感觉这很不公平.

Double standards like this are a daily occurrence.

> 这是日常双标呀.

If I asked my sister to bring me a cup of water, my mother would tell me that I'm sexist to expect everything of a woman.

> 如果我叫我妹给我倒一杯水,我妈会告诉我,对女性期待任何东西都是性别歧视.(窝草,不能忍的双标狗)

On the other hand, if my sister asks me to do something for her, my mother turns a blind eye.

> 另一方面,如果我妹叫我为她做些什么事,我妈就假装看不见.

If I mention anything about how unfair this is, they would call me a sexist, misogynistic pig.

> 如果我提及所有关于这些有多么不公平,她们会告诉我这是性别歧视,我是歧视女性的猪.

Meanwhile, they joke about how men can’t survive without women in their lives.

> 同时,她们拿男人如果没有女人根本活不下去来开玩笑.

If this is what feminism looks like, then I don’t want it.

> 如果这些就是所谓的女权主义,我宁愿不要女权主义.

I want to be equal as my sister.

> 我想和我妹一样被公平对待.

I want to be treated fairly.

> 我希望被公平对待.

Why is that so difficult?

## 你为什么取消婚礼?

From:  [Why did you call off your wedding?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-you-call-off-your-wedding/answers/67067066?srid=uv7Kg)

Date: January 12 2018

I was to get married to this guy in September. Ours was an intense romance. My parents were against our marriage and gave me hell for a long time (almost all the time I was in a relationship with this guy).

> 我和这个男在 9 月份结婚了.我们之间很,很,很浪漫.我的父母一直反对这门婚姻而且不给我好的脸色看(几乎在我和他确定关系的这段时间都没给我好脸色看).

He was generous, kind and very loving. He was in the Army and doing very well professionally. His parents really liked me and I used to meet them all the time. My own parents didn’t like this at all.

> 他很慷慨,热心和十分热爱.他在军队里面也做得十分好.在和他们家庭聚会的时候,他的父母亲也挺喜欢我的.但我的父母一点也不喜欢这门婚事.

Eventually my parents gave up the battle and agreed to get us married. For the first time in two years, I thought I could breathe easy now. My parents got off my back and my guy was really happy too. Everything seemed to be falling in place now.

> 最后我的父母放弃了这场战斗然后同意我们结婚.在两年来,我第一次感到呼吸没那么沉重了.我的父母不拖我的后腿,我告诉你,那是真正的开心呀.所有的事情看起来步入正轨.

Except this prickling at the back of my neck. And no matter how much I tried, it just didn’t budge.

> 除了从我颈背传来的刺痛感.无论我多么努力尝试,那么刺痛感一直挥之不去.

During this time, I realised some things about our relationship. These are the reasons why I called off my wedding:

> 在这期间,我意识到我们关系之间的一些东西.这些是我为什么取消婚礼的原因:

a. My guy was a rally racer. He used to drive exceptionally well. I was still learning how to drive back then. When we would ride together, he’d do stunts with the car and then ask me casually, “Hey, babe.. you could never make such turns on a crowded road, could you?”
I used to wear a bracelet which was a simple chain with a heart dangling on it. He took it one day and engraved his initials on it. Without asking me.

> 我的男朋友是赛车手.他习惯开得出乎异常的好.我那会还在学开车.当我们一起开车的时候,他会用车来表演,然后(假装无意的问起我),"hey,babe....你不可能在拥堵的主交通道路里面做这个动作,是吧?"我之前习惯带着一条项链上面有一个心形的吊坠.然后刻入她的首字母在那里.甚至根本没有问过我.

b. When back from parties, he would rave about how I was the prettiest girl in the party and how every guy checked me out. How jealous they all must be.

> 当从聚会回来,他会吼着说在聚会上我是多么漂亮的一个女孩子,那些男的是怎样看着我.他们有多么的妒忌.

c. He resented that I earned more than him. It pissed him off, visibly so. I worked for a corporate and earned well. He would, however, accept the expensive gifts I gave him. I also paid for his travelling often. He was generally short of money because he used to party a lot.

> 他憎恨我收入比他多.显然易见,这让他觉得有点操蛋.我为一家公司工作,而且收入很好.他可以,不论怎样,接受那些我给他昂贵的礼物.我还经常为他的旅行付账.他经常缺钱,因为他经常去参加聚会.

d. He disliked it if I hung out with my (male) friends. He once said to me, “You are out on a drive with a guy at 10 in the night. In a car.” I was out for dinner with a very good friend of mine who I’d known for years. He was dropping me back to my place. My friend heard his shrieking. He had the decency to not mention it.

> 他不喜欢我跟男性朋友玩(那你喜欢他跟女性朋友玩吗?).有一次他对我说,"你竟然在晚上 10 点和一个男的坐一辆车."当时我和一个很好的朋友出去吃饭,那个朋友我都认识一年多了.他把我运回我的地方.我朋友听到他的责问.但我朋友为了避免我尴尬没有去提及过.

So, in January, I gave him an ultimatum. I told him to mend his ways or I will leave. He said to me, “Everyone knows that we are dating. See, I’m a guy. I’ll be okay. If you leave me, who will marry you?”

> 所在,在 1 月份,我给了他最后的一次机会.我告诉他要改正他的行为,否则我会离开他.他告诉我,"每个人都知道我们在约会,你知道的,我是男的.我没什么影响.但你离开,谁还会娶你?"(被爱的有恃无恐)

It’s been 4 years since that decision. At the time, I couldn’t explain why I was doing what I was doing ~ Making a decision. Going crazy to defend my decision. Doing a complete 360 when everyone agreed to my decision. My parents were so shocked they didn’t speak. They didn’t retort. They didn’t ask me why. They just stayed silent.

> 做出那个决定后已经四年了.在那时候我都不清楚我在做什么~下决策.疯狂的不改变自己的决定.然后转变其他人对我的态度来支持我的决定.我的父母震惊到不能说话.他们没有和我争执.甚至都没问我原因.他们仅仅沉默不语.(哀莫大于心死)

To say that it was a humiliating experience would be an understatement.

> 这样来陈述一个尴尬的经历是一件轻描淡写的事.

In the bargain, I saved myself from marrying a chauvinist, egoist, macho-maniac who had zero financial intelligence. I also learnt that loving someone does not mean being the second wheel. You cannot ride shotgun your entire life. And even when we ride with someone on the rails of life, we still must carefully stoke our own engines too.

> 在这场交易里面,我保护我自己不嫁给一个自私的男权,还 tmd 经济头脑为 0 的人.我同时学会了去爱某个人并不意味着要放弃自我.你不可能在你一辈子都开得那么快的.即使我们和其他人一起在人生的道路上奔驰,我们依然要很小心我们自己的引擎是否太过头了.

I was feeling very suicidal for the past few days and I showed up to work feeling very hopeless and down. I am a preschool teacher so it takes everything I have to put a “happy act” on for the kids everyday. With this particular day being one of the worst days I've had in a while, I was terrified of being alone with my thoughts so I didn't call in sick. I showed up and walked into the classroom trying to smile and pretend I didn't want to end my life. As soon as I walked in something unexpected happened. About 6 preschoolers came running at me giving me hugs and holding on tight to my legs. Then more came running and this one little girl looked me in the eyes and said “I love you Miss Sara” as she gave me a hug. This created a chain reaction of kisses and hugs from all my little ones, all saying I love you… almost as if they knew how I was feeling. Immediately I had to fight back tears and stop myself from breaking down. In that moment I could physically feel the love and I knew that even though I did not want to live, I had to for these kids. And I finally felt like I could breathe again. Like purpose just got put back into my life. I never knew how much of an impact I had on these kids lives.

> 前些天,我感觉我有自杀的倾向,在工作的时候我感觉毫无希望和失落.我是一个幼儿园的老师,所以不得不每天都为那些小屁孩装作开心的样子.在这一阵子,最糟糕的一天里面,我对独自面对自己的想法感到害怕,所以我没有请假,还继续去上课.我准时上班,然后走进课室里面,我尝试去笑一下,然后假装我不想结束我的绳命(嗯,绳命)一样.就在我走进教室的那会,一些意料外的事发生了.差不多 6 个小屁孩跑向我,跑过来抱着我,抱着我的腿.然后其他的小屁孩也跑过来了,然后一个小女孩在抱着我的时候,看着我说"I love you,Miss sara".这好像从小屁孩里面的轻吻和拥抱里面创建了一个链式反应,全都说我爱你....就像 ta 们知道我的感受一样.我好不容易忍住了眼泪,然后让自己停止处于崩溃状态.在那一刻,我亲身感受到爱,即使在我不想活下去的情况下,我必须为这些小屁孩做些什么.我终于感觉可以再次呼吸了.就像从新把生活的意义塞进我的生命里面.我从不知道这些小屁孩对我有这么大的影响.

This little yet significant surprise made a huge difference not only in my day, but my life.

At 27 I ignored all the thoughtful, experienced, well meaning and loving advice my mother and father, friends, and neighbors heaped on me and said “Yes” when a scruffy, unemployed, homeless guy I’d only met 3 months earlier asked me to marry him. The general consensus was, “She’s out of her mind, it won’t last a year, he’ll take everything she’s got and leave her flat.”

> 在我 27 岁的时候,我忽略了我父母,朋友,邻居给予我所有慎重考虑的,经历过的,出于好心和爱我的建议,对一个邋遢,无家可归,失业,我们只认识 3 个月,早前叫我嫁给他的人说了"Yes".ta 们舆论一般是,"她一定是傻掉了,最多不能保持一年,他就会带走她所有的东西,只留下地板给她."

How did that risk work out? 35 years later I’m still out of my mind in love, he stole my heart and gave me his in return. He cleaned up pretty good, got a job, went back to college, got his degree, graduated Phi Theta Kappa. Got a better job. He took care of both my parents when they were ill, rebuilt our family home by hand when it burned in a fire. Has nursed me when I was sick, when I was injured in a bad fall and thought I’d never walk again, he told me, “H\*\*\* yes you’ll walk, you're a tough stubborn lady, now lean on me and lets do more of that therapy”. 6 months later I was walking without a cane. When he got hurt himself later, I stood by him exactly the same.

> 最后这个风险怎样了?在那 35 年后,我一直都像傻掉一样爱着,他偷走了我的心,把他的心放到了我的里面.他把自己整理干净,找到一份工作,重新回到学校里面,拿到了学位,在 Phi Theta Kappa 里面毕业.得到一份更好的工作.他在我父母生病的时候照顾好他们,亲手重建我们在火灾里面被烧毁的房子.在我生病的时候,他照料我,当我受伤躺在床上,想我永远也不能再次行走的时候,他告诉我,"草他的,你会自己走的,你可是很坚强的女人呀,现在走向我,来做多一些治疗".半年后,我可以不用拐杖就可以自己行走了.在之后,他受伤的时候,我在他身边做着他对我做的事.

He’s never failed to make me laugh my butt off at his cornball jokes and says making me smile at least twice a day his life’s mission. Defends me against all comers. He both emotionally and financially supported both me and my family during the tough times when my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimers . Yeah, it was a risk, a good risk and I’ve never regretted it.

> 他的粗俗笑话从来都会让我笑到怀疑人生,而且说每天让我最少笑两次是他一生的任务.保护我对抗那些带着恶意的人.他在我家庭处于我爸被确诊为老年痴呆症的艰难时刻在精神和经济上支持我.是的,当初这个是冒险,一个好的冒险,而我从来没后悔过.(我拒绝这样的狗粮,在星期一,星期二,星期三,星期四,星期五,星期六和星期天)

Today I was in Gloucester, doing my driving test.

> 今天我在 Gloucester,进行驾驶测试(考驾驶证吧,我想).

I gave a homeless guy some change, about fifty pence - I try to give something if I can. Later on I saw the same homeless guy smoking a cigarette. And my first thought was basically: ‘Oh, so you're wasting my money on fags? You should buy yourself food with that.’

> 我把一些零钱给了一个流浪汉,大概 50 便士-我想把我一些能给的给他.晚一点之后,我看见那个流浪汉正在那里抽烟.而我的第一想法差不多:"啊,所以你把我的钱浪费在香烟上面了?你应该给你自己买一点食物的."

And then I evaluated that thought. It said a lot about me. Firstly, despite the fact that I gave him the money freely, I felt like I should have control over its use, and I still felt like it was my money. What's more, I felt a desire to govern his behavior. On some level I felt like the fact I gave him money meant I had a say in his behaviour. Finally, I assumed I knew better than him; that food was what he needed, when, in reality, cigarettes may be the only luxury he has in life.

> 然后我开始审视我的想法.这对我说明了很多东西.首先,令人沮丧的是我给了 ta 钱,我就想来控制他对钱的使用,同时我还在想那是我的钱.更多的是,我觉得我应该要去纠正他的行为.在某些方面来说,我感觉我给了他那些钱,然后我必须要对他的行为说些什么.最后,我假设我自己才是比他更了解他自己的人.那些食物是他要的吗?当在现实里面,香烟对他来说才是他最奢侈的享受呢?

I stood there and, even if only for a moment, felt like this homeless guy, who has nothing, was slighting me by engaging in a perfectly normal behaviour. All because I did what I felt was a kind act.

> 我站在那里,尽管只有那一会,就想那个流浪汉一样,对他人来说他谁也不是,完全忽视我自己一个正常完美的帮助他人的行为.全都是因为我做了我以为是好的事.

A 97 year old Japanese woman visits a nearby Buddhist temple every evening to pray, and ring the bell until the sun sets. On one of my own routine visits, I lay inconspicuously near the stairs listening to the vibrations take over the silent winter evening. Only this day I failed to wake up before she finished, and soon found myself at the end of her walking stick.

Whenever in life you have to make a genuinely tough decision or take a pick between two choices,
FLIP A COIN.

> 不论在什么时候,你必须要做一个艰难的决策或者在两个选择中不知选取哪个的时候,抛一枚狗日的硬币吧.

The coin won't decide for you, but you will realize what you really want when it's mid-air.

> 硬币不会帮你决定什么,但硬币在空中的时候,你会意识到你真正想要的是什么.

I realized this on my 25th birthday.

> 我是在我 25 岁生日的时候意识到的.

I used to put birthday on Facebook until the age of 24 and I used to get a lot of wishes.

> 之前我习惯把我的生日公布在 facebook 上,还得到很多的祝福,直到我 24 岁之后.

In fact, my 24th birthday was on Sunday, 35 friends showed up. I was given a party by 3 group of friends and I did remember cutting 4 birthday cakes on the same day. People who could not join also wished by a call.

> 事实上,我 24 岁生日是在星期天,来了 35 个朋友.我给 3 群朋友开了一个 party,而且我还记得在那一天我切开了 4 个生日蛋糕.那些不能来的人,也打电话来祝福我.

Now how much can change over one year! For my 25th birthday, I removed it from Facebook to check who remembers. And this time it was Monday. Monday, the day of work.

> 现在,一年改变了多少!在我 25 生日的时候,我从 facebook 去掉那个提示,看看谁记得(窝草,说得好像你记得别人的一样,呸).然后这时是星期一.星期一,上班的那天.

No parties, no calls, 3 people texted me to wish, one just wrote HBD. No cakes. Funny thing is that even family did not call assuming I will be out with friends.

> 没聚会,没有电话,3 个人给我发生日祝福信息,一个仅仅写了 HBD(Happy Birthday).没蛋糕.最有趣的是,我的家人没给我电话,因为他们觉得我会和朋友出去.(按照你现在的情况,不好意思,这届比惨大会,是我赢了)

That day I realized, no one cares.

> 然后那一天,我意识到,根本没人在乎.

Now I celebrate my birthday alone and donate money to charity. I make sure that charity money amount is equal to the cost of food and drinks for 35 people and 3 cakes.

> 现在我自己庆祝我的生日然后捐款给教堂.我确保捐出去的钱可以等于那 35 个人和 3 个蛋糕的消费价格.

Social experimentation is required to find wolves in this highly connected tech era.

> 社交实验是要求在这个信息高度连接的纪元里面寻找那些狼的.

Once, before the existence of email, I assured my boss email was the stupidest thing I had ever heard and that we would not need it.

Another time, a woman who worked for me asked me to help her get a job that was being offered out of our company's office in China. Her husband had just begun working for a start up and she was hungry for a new adventure.

> 另外一次,一个为我工作的女人向我寻求帮助找到一份工作,那份为公司提供咖啡在中国工作的职位.她的老公刚开启起步项目,然后她就渴求新的历险了.

"Please don't do this" I said. "Your husband should go with you, or you should stay. Your relationship is more important than work." She didn't listen and I helped her despite my reluctance and she had an incredible experience.

> "请不要做这件事"我说."你老公应该跟你一起去的,或者你应该留下来.你们的感情比工作更重要."她没有听我的话,我虽然不情愿但还是帮她了,然后她有了一场难忘的经历.

A very smart woman I worked with once told me that if I eliminated the word "but" from my professional vocabulary, I'd find greater acceptance for my ideas, and greater cooperation from my team members. She said people would have a very different perception of me if I could change this one thing.

> 我工作里,一个十分聪明的女士告诉我,如果我把"but(但是)"这个单词从我的词典里面淘汰的话,我的主意会被他人更好的接受,同时我团队里面的成员也会合作得多.她说如果你能改变这个,人们会对你有不同的认识.

The reason, she said, is because the word "but" negates everything that precedes it, and you cast a negative spin on anything you say when you use it.

> 这个原因,她说,是因为那个"but"否定了之前所有的东西,如果你用到这个词,那就是把你之前说的都否决掉了.(....,But, I love you babe)

Consider, for example, "We can do it this way, but it'll be way too expensive given our budget," versus "We can do it this way, and if we do, we'll need to cut back on other important features." The first indicates that we can't even consider the option. The second acknowledges possibility and describes consequences.

> 考虑一下,比如,"我们可以这样子做,但这会花费我们很多的钱,"相对应的是,"我们可以这样子做,如果我们这样子做,我们需要削减其他的重要部分开支".第一个表明我们甚至都不能考虑那个意见.第二个可能会被承认同时造成一系列好的影响.

"But" is exclusive and isolating, "and" is inclusive and welcoming.

> "But"是排出和孤立,"And"是包容和欢迎.(And fuck you ,you piece of shit)

She was absolutely right, and it's advice I have used with great success for the past 30 years of my life.

> 她绝壁是对的,同时这个意见在过去的 30 年里边,使我获得了巨大的成功.
